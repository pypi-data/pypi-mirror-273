# OTP GENERATOR
This project was created to produce a unique one-time password (**OTP**) using either
a mobile or ten-digit number. The key idea behind the OTP is that it does not 
repeat itself. For instance, if you provide an interval time in minutes, the OTP 
generated will be based on that interval. For example, if you set the interval to
five minutes, the same OTP will be generated for five minutes. If you do not specify
an interval, the default time of two minutes will be used and the same OTP will be 
generated for two minutes.


## What is it?

    print(otp)
To change interval time pass the value in minutes.
        
    from otp_generate import generate_otp
