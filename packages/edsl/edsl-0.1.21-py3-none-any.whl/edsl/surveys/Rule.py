"""The Rule class defines a rule for determining the next question presented to an agent.

The key component is an expression specifiying the logic of the rule, which can include any combination of logical operators ('and', 'or', 'not'), e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    "q1 == 'yes' or q2 == 'no'"

The expression must be about questions "before" the current question.

Only one rule should apply at each priority level.
If multiple rules apply, the one with the highest priority is used. 
If there are conflicting rules, an exception is raised.

If no rule is specified, the next question is given as the default.
When a question is added with index, it is always given a rule the next question is index + 1, but
with a low (-1) priority.
