- Purpose: Code for visualizing decision graphs and explorations.

Defines functions for graph layout and drawing for
`exploration.core.DecisionGraph` objects, and for visualizing
`DiscreteExploration` objects as an animation or sequence of
`DecisionGraph` images. Since the focal example is Metroidvania games, we
use a square-tiles-based map system as the basis for layout. This will
not work well for non-planar graphs.

TODO: Anchor-free localization implementation?
