# re(sh)ipe

### **Introducing re(sh)ipe: Streamlined Data Transformation and Validation**

re(sh)ipe is a sophisticated Python module designed to integrate data reshaping with recipe-driven processing. Developed primarily for parsing metadata from MRI raw data to ensure BIDS compliance, re(sh)ipe leverages a YAML-based configuration that simplifies handling complex data structures, making it highly suitable for researchers and developers in neuroimaging.

**Core Features:**

- **Detailed Data Specifications:** (WIP) Utilize YAML files to define data types and constraints rigorously. This feature includes regex-aware type restrictions that are essential for adhering to BIDS standards.
- **Flexible Parsing Mechanisms:** The module's recipe-based approach allows for the dynamic parsing of metadata from Python objects. It includes options for conditional parsing paths and the integration of pre-processing scripts to enhance data workflow efficiency.

Explore the capabilities of re(sh)ipe, where sophisticated data processing is seamlessly combined with precision and adaptability for neuroimaging data management.
