# pyvisjs: Python Wrapper for vis.js Network

pyvisjs is a Python package designed to provide seamless interaction with [vis.js](https://visjs.org) network visualizations, allowing users to manipulate and visualize network data using Python.

## Features

- **Integration**: Easily incorporate vis.js network visualizations into your Python projects.
- **Flexibility**: Leverage the power of Python to manipulate network data and customize visualizations.
- **Interactivity**: Enable users to interact with network visualizations directly from Python scripts.

## Installation

You can install PyVisjs via pip:

```bash
pip install pyvisjs
```

## Usage

```python
from pyvisjs import Network

# Create a Network instance
net = Network()

# Add nodes and edges

net.add_node(2)
net.add_edge(1, 2)

# Display the network
net.show("example.html")
