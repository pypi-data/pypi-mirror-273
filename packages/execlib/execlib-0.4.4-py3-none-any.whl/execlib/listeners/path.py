        Note: on renamed/moved directories
            This method is used to reset the mapped path/lead tuples pointed to by certain
            watch descriptors when a directory is renamed. iNotify will fire a MOVED event

            the router. Explicitly re-watching the renamed directory (and any

        Update directories on ``MOVED_FROM`` events. 

        .. admonition:: Additional details

            This method gets the existing WD, removes the old path associated with that WD
            from the ``watchmap`` (preventing events originating from this old path when the
            new path, which has the *same WD*, receives an inotify event), and queues the (WD,
            base path) tuple to be matched later in a ``MOVED_TO`` handler.

            This method isn't a part of a ``MOVED_TO`` handler because it may be called
            without ever having a ``MOVED_TO`` that follows up. We respond right away in
            ``handle_events`` to ``MOVED_FROM`` events, keeping the ``watchmap`` in sync,
            regardless of whether we can expect a ``MOVED_TO`` to sweep through after the
            fact.

            Note that the ``lead`` is unique for a given WD and base path. WDs are unique for
            filepaths, but inotify uses the same WD for new directories when they experience a
            rename (it's the same inode). However, during such a transition, the ``watchmap``
            can see two different entries for the same WD and basepath: the old tracked path,
            and the newly named one (again, still the same inode). So: this method can be
            called 1) directly from ``MOVED_FROM`` events, preemptively wiping the old path
            from the tracked dicts, or 2) during handling of a ``MOVED_TO`` event (in case we
            don't allow ``MOVED_FROM`` events, for instance), given both the new and old paths
            can be seen in the ``watchmap``.

        Construct synthetic MOVED events. Events are constructed from the path's WD. If
        the provided path is not watched, an empty list of events is returned.

        .. admonition:: Design details

            This method is nuanced. It can only be called once a ``MOVED_TO`` occurs, since
            we can't act on a ``MOVED_FROM`` (we don't know the new target location to look
            so we can send file events). When called, we first look for the path's WD in
            the ``pathmap``. We then check if this WD points to more than one entry with the
            same base path (WDs are unique to the path; under the same WD, the same base
            path implies the same lead). If so, we know one is the outdated path, and we
            push the outdated lead to ``update_moved_from``. This would be evidence that the
            ``MOVED_FROM`` event for the move operation wasn't handled in the main event
            handling loop. We then check for unmatched move-froms, which should provide
            any renamed directories, regardless of whether ``MOVED_FROMs`` were allowed, to
            be detected. Finally, the appropriate ``MOVED_FROMs`` and ``MOVED_TOs`` are
            handled. To ensure only the correct events match upon handling, we do the
            following:

            - First, if a ``MOVED_FROM`` path is not available, we assume it wasn't queued
              by the event and not a watched flag. Given we by default ensure MOVED events
              are tracked, regardless of listened paths, this shouldn't be possible, but
              if this standard were to change, we won't recursively respond to
              ``MOVED_FROMs``. This will mean that we can't prevent events from being
              matched to old directory names (we've rooted out the ability to tell when
              they've changed), and thus can't remove them from the ``watchpath``
              accordingly. (One functional caveat here: this MOVED_TO handling method
              explicitly calls ``updated_moved_from``, which should clean up lingering
              renamed path targets. This happens recursively if we're watching MOVED_TOs,
              so even if standards do change and you don't watch ``MOVED_FROMs``, you'll
              still get clean up for free due to the robustness of this method.
            - If a ``MOVED_FROM`` lead is found, either due to an inferred matching base
              lingering in the ``watchmap`` or through previously handled ``MOVED_FROM``
              response, add this path/lead back to the ``watchmap``, remove the new
              path/lead, and call ``handle_events`` for the synthetic ``MOVED_FROM`` events
              across files and directories.  Once finished, again remove the old path/lead
              and add back the new one.
            - Submit ``MOVED_TO`` events to ``handle_events``. This will recursively propagate for
              subdirectories, each submitting their own ``update_moved_to`` call, resetting
              its own outdated leads and changing them back, all the way down to the
              bottom. 

            In the odd case where ``MOVED_FROM`` is registered but not ``MOVED_TO``, you will
            simply remove the directory causing a ``MOVED_FROM`` event, with no recursive
            propagation. This should likely be changed.
