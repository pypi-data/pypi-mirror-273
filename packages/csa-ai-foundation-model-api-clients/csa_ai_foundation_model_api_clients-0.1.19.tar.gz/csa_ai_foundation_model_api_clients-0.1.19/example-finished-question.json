            "content": "7.4 Zero Trust & SASE\nZero Trust operates on the assumption that trust is never implicit, and robust verification is required at all times for any user or device accessing the network. This section introduces the Zero Trust architectural framework and the technologies that support it, such as software-defined perimeter (SDP) and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Additionally, it details how SASE integrates various security functions into a unified, cloud-delivered service, addressing the needs of increasingly distributed environments. SASE complements this by merging network and security functions to deliver secure, scalable access to cloud services, optimizing performance and security for distributed environments. This section explores the foundational concepts, benefits, and implementation strategies of Zero Trust and SASE, detailing how they effectively protect cloud architectures and networks.\n\n7.4.1 Zero Trust for Cloud Infrastructure & Networks\n\nZero Trust as a general security strategy is discussed in Domain 2: Cloud Governance & Strategies and a number of other useful references on the CSA Zero Trust Resource Hub, including the ZT Guiding Principles document.\n\nZero Trust is a cybersecurity strategy premised on the idea that no user or asset is to be implicitly trusted. It assumes that a breach has already occurred, or will occur, and therefore, a user should not be granted access to sensitive information by a single verification done at the enterprise perimeter. Instead, each user, device, application, and transaction must be continually verified. \n\nZero Trust focuses on providing broad-based protections for business assets in a risk-based manner.  Zero Trust security principles are grouped into a set of pillars that resemble Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) control domains and are designed to work together in concert to provide robust  protections for key assets and resources. These security pillars and their respective capabilities and functions are described in the US CISA ZT Maturity Model and DoD ZT Reference Architecture reference documents. While their depictions of the pillars differ somethat their models are basically equivalent and fundamentally consistent. \n\nWhile we focus on the network architecture aspects of  Zero Trust in CCSK Domain 7, implementing a ZTA involves a comprehensive, full stack, multi-pillar approach to security that assumes no trust, whether access is requested from inside or outside the network perimeter. We will dive deeper into these pillars in CCSK Domain 11. \n\n7.4.1.1 Foundational ZT Concepts & Capabilities\n\nZero Trust is a security strategy that is particularly relevant for modern cloud infrastructure and networks where business applications and assets are often distributed across different environments and users are often remote and frequently access business systems over the Internet. By adhering to Zero Trust principles, organizations can enhance the security posture of their cloud environments, reducing the risk and potential impact of security breaches, unauthorized access, and lateral movement by attackers. However, implementing Zero Trust generally requires a holistic, full-stack approach, integrating people, processes, and technology across the cloud landscape. This can be accomplished by implementing an appropriately tailored combination of the following security measures.\n\n1.  Continuous Verification:\nImplement phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all user and administrative access, including cloud console access and API calls.\nContinuously validate user identities, device posture, and session context throughout the user's session by implementing Context Based Access Control (CBAC), which can include RBAC and ABAC.\nUse security analytics and user/entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to detect anomalies and risky behavior, particularly for highly sensitive and administrative access.\n\n2.  Least-Privileged Access:\nFollow the principle of least privilege by granting users and applications only the minimum permissions necessary for their business function.\nUse just-in-time (JIT) access and time-limited credentials for elevated privileges.\nRegularly review and revoke unused or excessive permissions and promptly revoke all access of terminated users through access governance processes.\n\n3.  Micro-Segmentation:\nImplement network segmentation using VPCs, VNets, virtual firewalls, and similar constructs.\nDivide cloud networks into smaller, isolated segments based on workload criticality and security requirements using network security groups (NSGs), and network access control lists (NACLs)..\nEnforce granular segmentation policies and control lateral movement between segments.\nRestrict communication between segments and services based on the principle of least privilege.\n\n4. Infrastructure and Workload Security:\nDeploy intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious traffic.\nDeploy workloads in dedicated, isolated environments (e.g., VMs, containers, serverless functions) with secure boundaries.\nUtilize service mesh architectures and identity-based communication between microservices.\nImplement workload and container runtime protections, vulnerability management, and firewalling.\nLeverage hardware security features like encrypted VMs and confidential computing enclaves.\nAutomate security processes such as vulnerability scanning, patch management, and configuration management using DevSecOps practices.\nAdopt immutable infrastructure and ephemeral workload patterns for security and consistency.\nUtilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to provision and configure cloud resources securely.\n\n5.  Data Security:\nEncrypt data at rest and in transit (e.g., with mutual TLS) using strong encryption algorithms and robust key management practices.\nImplement robust backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity in the event of a security breach, ransomware attack or data loss.\nMonitor and audit data access and usage patterns for potential misuse and exfiltration attempts.\nImplement data loss prevention (DLP) controls and data masking techniques.\n\n6.  Monitoring and Logging:\nImplement centralized access and traffic logging and monitoring for cloud infrastructure, networks, and workloads.\nCollect and analyze security logs, flow logs, and audit trails for threat detection and incident response leveraging cloud-native logging, monitoring and alerting services.\nConfigure alerts and triggers to notify administrators of suspicious activities or security breaches.\nImplement security information and event management (SIEM) systems for log aggregation, correlation, and analysis.\nAutomate security response and remediation with security orchestration and automation (SOAR) tools.\n\nExample: Zero Trust fine-grained access control policy for highly sensitive information in the cloud can include validating strong, recent authentication of the user requesting access, with validation of the identity and security hygiene of their endpoint device, that their network and geolocation is acceptable for the time and type of data and workload access requested, cross-checking that they\u2019re not logged in from several different geographic locations at the same time, and that the requested access doesn\u2019t fit an insider risk access profile using behavioral analytics.\n\nBy following these guidelines and principles, you can establish a robust security posture for your cloud infrastructure and networks based on the Zero Trust strategy, helping to mitigate security risks and protecting your organization's sensitive data and resources.\n\n7.4.1.2 Zero Trust Conceptual Architecture\n\nNIST Special Publication 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture provides a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) component model that\u2019s also covered in detail in the CSA ZTA training study guide, as depicted below. \n\nCSA Adaptation of ZTA Core Logical Components Diagram (NIST 800-207 pg. 9)\n\nNIST 2020 Special Publication 800-207 provides a simple representation of the key logical components of a ZTA (shown above). In the NIST ZT model, ZT access policies are defined, managed, and enforced using the Policy Decision Point (PDP) and the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). The PDP and PEP regulate resource access by placing them in the traffic access workflow. The PDP comprises a policy administrator and policy engine, which determine the rules and commute them to the PEP. The PEP acts as a gateway to ensure that the correct access has been granted to the right entity, with the correct access level to an approved resource.  \n\nNIST defines the PDP as residing in the control plane and is the component of the logical architecture that has the responsibility to collect, analyze, and transform the data first into intelligence and then into rules to govern the access to resources; and the PEP resides in the the data plane and is the ZT component that, based on input passed by the control plane, has the responsibility to enforce the rules and provide access to the resources (data).\n\nVarious security related data sources feed information to the PDP to maintain the rules and keep the overall decision-making process current. Various sources of intelligence feed into the policy engine and support the policy administrator in defining and refining the access rules. \n\n7.4.3 Software Defined Perimeter & Zero Trust Network Access\n\nTwo key technology approaches that enable Zero Trust network security are Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP). These approaches are not mutually exclusive and elements of each can be combined into a tailored ZT security implementation.\n\nSoftware Defined Perimeter (SDP)\nEstablishes a secure, \"dark\" network that is invisible to unauthorized users and devices.\nImplements a \"black out\" approach, where the network is inaccessible by default.\nUsers and devices must authenticate and be authorized before they can access the SDP-protected resources.\nSDP leverages identity-centric controls and micro-segmentation to limit lateral movement.\n\nZero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)\nReplaces traditional VPNs with a more granular, application-specific access control model.\nUsers are verified and authorized based on identity, device, location, and other contextual factors.\nAccess is provided to specific applications or resources, rather than granting broad network access.\nZTNA solutions can be cloud-hosted (ZTNA-as-a-Service) or on-premises.\n\nBy implementing Zero Trust network security principles, organizations can significantly enhance their overall security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and better protect their assets in the face of evolving cyber threats. The combination of ZTNA and SDP provides a robust framework for securing modern, cloud-centric and remote-access-intensive IT environments. NIST SP 800-215, Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape is a good reference for these topics.\n\n7.4.3.1 Software Defined Perimeter\nSDP is a Zero Trust network security architecture that is implemented to provide full (OSI network) stack security. SDP implementations hide assets and authorize access using a separate control plane and data plane prior to allowing any connections to hidden assets. SDP implements foundational Zero Trust principles. \n\nZT implementations require the verification of anything and everything attempting to access assets before authorization. Additionally, ZT requires continued evaluation of sessions and their risk levels during the entire duration of the connection. \u201cA ZT implementation using SDP enables organizations to defend new variations of old attack methods constantly surfacing in existing network and infrastructure perimeter-centric networking models. Implementing SDP improves the security posture of businesses that face the challenge of continuously adapting to expanding attack surfaces that are increasingly more complex.\u201d The enterprise must monitor the security posture of the assets. SDP enforces this access management strategy by enabling a default drop-all gateway until users/devices are properly authenticated and authorized to access the hidden assets. By requiring the pre-vetting of connections, SDP enables complete control over who can connect, from which devices to what services, infrastructure, and other conditions and parameters, such as business/non-business hours and geolocation. \n\nAs described in the SDP Architecture Guide v2, SDP consists of the following major components:\nThe client/initiating host\nThe service/accepting host, also referred to as the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) per NIST\u2019s ZTA model\nAn SDP controller to which the accepting host and initiating host both connect, also referred to as the Policy Decision Point (PDP) per NIST\u2019s ZTA model\nAn SDP gateway that implements the drop-all firewall\n\nAccording to the SDP Architecture Guide v2, SDP works in the following manner:\nThe SDP client software on the initiating host opens a connection to the SDP. Initiating host devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, are user-facing, meaning the SDP client software is run on the devices themselves. The network can be outside the control of the enterprise operating the SDP.\nAccepting host devices accept connections from initiating hosts and provide a set of SDP-protecting/secured services. Accepting hosts typically reside on a network under the enterprise\u2019s control (and/or under the control of a direct representative).\nAn SDP gateway provides authorized users and devices with access to protected processes and services. The gateway can also enact monitoring, logging, and reporting on these connections.\n\nInitiating host and accepting host devices connect to an SDP controller: a device/appliance or process that secures access to isolated services by ensuring that:\nUsers are authenticated and authorized\nDevices are validated\nSecure communications are established \nUser and management traffic remain separate on the network\n\nThe controller and accepting host are invisible and inaccessible to unauthorized users and devices. SDP implementations can support several different connectivity configurations for different communications use cases. Reference the Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) Specification v2.0 for details.\n\n7.4.3.2 Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)\nZero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a key component of the Zero Trust security model, specifically focused on secure remote access to applications and resources.  ZTNA replaces traditional VPNs with a more granular, application-specific access control model. Users are verified and authorized to access specific applications or resources based on identity, device, location, and other contextual factors. \n\nBy implementing ZTNA principles, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface, enforce granular access controls, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and lateral movement within their networks and applications.\n\n7.4.3 SASE \n\nSecure Access Service Edge (SASE) is an emerging cybersecurity concept that combines network security functions with WAN and proxy capabilities to deliver a comprehensive, cloud-native service. It is designed to address the challenges of securing endpoint devices and access to applications and data in a cloud-first, mobile-first world, where users and resources are increasingly distributed outside of traditional network perimeters.\n\n7.4.3.1 SASE Framework & Architecture Overview\n\nSASE is a framework or architectural approach that combines networking and security functions into a single, cloud-delivered service. SASE aims to provide secure access to applications and data for users, regardless of their location, while also ensuring consistent security policies and controls across the organization's network.\n\n\n\nSASE plays a significant role in enabling Zero Trust security in cloud environments. Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies every access request, regardless of where it originates. SASE supports this by providing a unified platform for enforcing granular, context-aware access policies across all users, devices, and applications. It integrates security functions like secure web gateways, Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs), Zero Trust network access (ZTNA), and traditional firewall capabilities into a single, cloud-delivered service. This allows organizations to consistently apply security policies and monitor access to cloud resources, irrespective of the user's location or device.\n\n7.4.3.2 SASE Implementation & Benefits\n\nMoreover, SASE's integration of network and application layer security mechanisms simplifies the deployment and management of Zzero Ttrust in cloud environments. By delivering security as a cloud-native service, SASE reduces or eliminates the need to manage multiple-point products and enables organizations to scale their security infrastructure quickly as their cloud footprint grows. It also provides a more user-centric approach to security, with the ability to enforce policies based on user identity, device posture, and application sensitivity. This is essential for implementing least-privilege access in the cloud, where distributed and remote users require access to specific applications and data rather than entire networks.\n\nAs organizations continue to adopt cloud services and embrace remote work, SASE will be instrumental in realizing the full potential of Zero Trust security. By providing a unified, cloud-delivered platform for securing access to any application, from any device, over any network, SASE enables organizations to consistently enforce Zero Trust policies across their entire digital estate, including cloud, on premise and hybrid environments. This not only improves their overall security posture but also allows them to fully leverage the agility and scalability of the cloud without compromising on enterprise security.\n\nSummary\nSecuring cloud infrastructure is a dual-focus task that safeguards both the cloud provider's setup and the configurations deployed by customers. The core pillars of infrastructure security encompass creating secure architectures, ensuring configurations are secure from the start, integrating security early in the development lifecycle (shift-left practices), and maintaining vigilance through monitoring and applying guardrails.\n\nCloud networks, built on the principles of software-defined networks (SDNs), offer advanced security capabilities such as implementing a default deny policy, managing access and rules based on policies, and allowing for detailed network segmentation. These features significantly bolster the security framework within cloud environments.\n\nIncorporating Zero Trust principles, exemplified by Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), is essential for securing multi-cloud connectivity and achieving secure remote access. These models ensure that access is tightly controlled and given based on verified identity and context, enhancing security in distributed environments.\n\nContainer networking introduces a new layer of complexity by adding an abstraction layer above traditional virtualized cloud networks. This necessitates applying security measures at both the container and cloud network layers to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited.\n\nFinally, cloud network security isn't limited to just security groups. It also includes preventive measures like deploying firewalls, IDS/IPS, and WAFs, alongside detective controls, such as flow logs and traffic mirroring. These elements work together to form a robust defense against cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and resilience of cloud infrastructures for businesses leveraging cloud technology.\n\n\n"
