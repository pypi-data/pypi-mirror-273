# Jaxonloader

A dataloader that no one asked for, but here it is anyway.

## Documentation

Check out the docs [here](https://artur-galstyan.github.io/jaxonloader/)

## Installation

Install this package using pip like so:

```
pip install jaxonloader
```

## Philosophy

The `jaxonloader` package is designed to be as lightweight as possible. It's effectively the same as the PyTorch dataloader except that it uses Numpy as the backend.

## Roadmap

Other types of datasets can be added but not the datasets ifself. I've decided
that all I really need is the dataloader and dataset classes -- nothing more.
