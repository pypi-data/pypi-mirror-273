`mazikeen` is a test framework for command line applications.
`mazikeen` was created to facilitae testing of CLI application that have a predictable output. It facilitates testing on different operating systems by provideing a diff method that is agnostic to newline and make / remove directory. For `mazikeen` every test has it's own directory helping debugging and organizing tests.
`mazikeen` empathise parralel testing.

The test structure looks like:
::

    Testsuit1
    ├── Testcase1
    │   └── script.yaml
    ├── . . .
    └──TestcaseN
        └── script.yaml
    Testsuit2
    ├── Testcase1
    │   └── script.yaml
    ├── ...
    └──TestcaseN
        └── script.yaml
		
An example of a simple test:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # content of script.yaml
  ---
  steps:
    - rmdir: Output
    - makedirs: Output
    - run: echo "Hello World" > Output/hello.txt
    - diff: Output/hello.txt Expected/hello.txt

To execute it::

    $ mazikeen
    [RUN       ] --- simple
    [    PASSED] --- simple
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Total test cases: 1 passed: 1 skipped: 0 error: 0 failed: 0

    process time: 0.02 execution time: 0.01

Features
--------
- Provides diff functions agnostic to newline and other common operations for different operating systems like make and remove directory. 
- Every test case is a directory. Making it easy to debug a failing test as all relevant data is stored in one place.
- Parallel execution support. Testscases can be executed in parallel. A testcase can call multiple CLI applications in parallel.
