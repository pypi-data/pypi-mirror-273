## Typing stubs for uWSGI

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`uWSGI`](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`uWSGI`.

This version of `types-uWSGI` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `uWSGI==2.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/uWSGI. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Type hints for uWSGI's [Python API](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonModule.html). Note that this API is available only when running Python code inside a uWSGI process and some parts of the API are only present when corresponding configuration options have been enabled.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `77d6947479a7ba2cddc6b50d5600a941a84ca4d4` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.363, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
