##  Overview

The py-alpaca-api project is a Python library that simplifies interaction with the Alpaca API. It provides a robust interface, encapsulated in the `PyAlpacaApi` class, enabling developers to access Alpaca Market API trading functionalities effortlessly. By utilizing data classes for orders, assets, and accounts, the project abstracts away complexities, enhancing flexibility in processing API responses. With clear metadata management through Poetry, this project serves as a valuable tool for those looking to integrate Alpaca trading capabilities seamlessly into their applications.

This project is still in development. New functionality will be added and updated daily. Hopefully this project will help make communicating with Alpaca Markets API, much easier for some. Any input or help would be appreciated.

| [alpaca.py](https://github.com/TexasCoding/py-alpaca-api/blob/master/py_alpaca_api/alpaca.py) | The `alpaca.py` file in the `py-alpaca-api` repository contains a class called `PyAlpacaApi`, designed to interact with the Alpaca API. This class facilitates communication by handling API requests and responses, leveraging data classes for account, asset, and order information. The constructor requires the Alpaca API Key and Secret, with an option to specify the usage of the Alpaca Paper Trading API. This component serves as a fundamental interface for developers to access and manage Alpaca trading functionalities within the broader project architecture. |

##  Getting Started

**System Requirements:**

* **Python**: `version 3.12.3`

###  Installation

<h4>From <code>source</code></h4>

> 1. Clone the py-alpaca-api repository:
>
> ```console
> $ git clone https://github.com/TexasCoding/py-alpaca-api
> ```
>
> 2. Change to the project directory:
> ```console
> $ cd py-alpaca-api
> ```
>
> 3. Install the dependencies:
> Recommended way is to use poetry, to install all dependencies including dev
> ```console
> $ poetry install
> ```
> Using pip, this does not include -dev dependencies:
> ```console
> $ pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

###  Usage

<h4>Include PyAlpacaAPI In Your App</h4>

> ```python
> from py_alpaca_api.alpaca import PyAlpacaApi
>
> api_key = 'your_api_key'
> api_secret = 'your_api_secret'
>
> alpaca = PyAlpacaApi(api_key=api_key, api_secret=api_secret, api_paper=True)
>
> asset = alpaca.get_asset('AAPL')
>
> print(asset)
> ```

###  Tests

> Run the test suite using the command below:
> ```console
> $ pytest
> ```
