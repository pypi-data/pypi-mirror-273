        """
        An abstract dataset, containing the image data, noise-map, PSF and associated quantities for calculations
        like the grid.

        This object is extended with specific dataset types, such as an `Imaging` or `Interferometer` dataset,
        and can be used for fitting data with model data and quantifying the goodness-of-fit.

        The following quantities are abstract and used by any dataset type:

        - `data`: The image data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with a model image.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every pixel, which is used to compute the chi-squared value
        and likelihood of a fit.

        Datasets also contains following properties:

        - `grid`: A grids of (y,x) coordinates which align with the image pixels, whereby each coordinate corresponds to
        the centre of an image pixel. This may be used in fits to calculate the model image of the imaging data.

        - `grid_pixelization`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which align with the pixels of a pixelization. This grid
        is specifically used for pixelizations computed via the `inversion` module, which often use different
        oversampling and sub-size values to the grid above.

        The `over_sampling` and `over_sampling_pixelization` define how over sampling is performed for these grids.

        This is used in the project PyAutoGalaxy to load imaging data of a galaxy and fit it with galaxy light profiles.
        It is used in PyAutoLens to load imaging data of a strong lens and fit it with a lens model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The array of the image data containing the signal that is fitted (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the
            recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value, which
            can be used via a bespoke fit to account for correlated noise in the data.
        over_sampling
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which performs calculations not associated with a pixelization.
            In PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens this is light profile calculations.
        over_sampling_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
