### How to Obtain the LinkedIn Cookie (li_at)

3. Go to the "Application" tab (in Chrome) or "Storage" tab (in Firefox).
4. Expand the "Cookies" dropdown and select the LinkedIn URL.
5. Locate the li_at cookie and copy its value.

The `get_user_profile_data` function returns a dictionary with the following structure:

```bash
{
    "Basic Details": basic_details,
    "Work Experience Details": work_experience_details,
    "Education Details": education_details,
    "Project Details": projects_details,
    "Recommendations": recommendations
}
```

- `basic_details`: Contains basic information about the LinkedIn user. (Name, Title, Summary)
- `work_experience_details`: Contains details of the user's work experience (Title, Company, Duration).
- `education_details`: Contains details of the user's education (Institure, Course, Duration, Summary).
