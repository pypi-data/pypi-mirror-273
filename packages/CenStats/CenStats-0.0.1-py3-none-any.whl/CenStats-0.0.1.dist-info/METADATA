# `CenStats`
[![CI](https://github.com/logsdon-lab/centromere-status-checker/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/logsdon-lab/centromere-status-checker/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Determine the status of centromeric contigs based on [`RepeatMasker`](https://www.repeatmasker.org/) annotations.

### Setup
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/logsdon-lab/CenStats.git
```

### Usage
Takes `RepeatMasker` output from centromeric contigs to check and centromeric contigs from a reference.
```
usage: censtats [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] -r REFERENCE [--dst_perc_thr DST_PERC_THR] [--edge_perc_alr_thr EDGE_PERC_ALR_THR] [--edge_len EDGE_LEN]
                 [--max_alr_len_thr MAX_ALR_LEN_THR]

Determines if centromeres are incorrectly oriented/mapped with respect to a reference.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input RepeatMasker output. Should contain contig reference. Expects no header.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        List of contigs with actions required to fix.
  -r REFERENCE, --reference REFERENCE
                        Reference RM dataframe.
  --dst_perc_thr DST_PERC_THR
                        Edit distance percentile threshold. Lower is more stringent.
  --edge_perc_alr_thr EDGE_PERC_ALR_THR
                        Percent ALR on edges of contig to be considered a partial centromere.
  --edge_len EDGE_LEN   Edge len to calculate edge_perc_alr_thr.
  --max_alr_len_thr MAX_ALR_LEN_THR
                        Length of largest ALR needed in a contig to not be considered a partial centromere.
```

```bash
censtats -i input_cens.out -r ref_cens.out > cens_status.tsv
```

Return tab-delimited output with the following fields:
1. Original contig name.
2. Remapped contig name.
3. Correct orientation of contig with `fwd` indicating an already correctly oriented contig.
4. Contig is a partial centromeric contig.

### Similarity Metrics
Two metrics are used to determine orientation and mapping.
* [Jaccard index](https://www.statisticshowto.com/jaccard-index/)
* [Edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) using the [`editdistance`](https://pypi.org/project/editdistance/) library.

### Algorithm
1. Every centromeric contig and its reverse orientation is paired with a reference centromeric contig.
    * Repeat types are used to gauge similarity.

2. Next, the both metrics are calculated for each pair.
    * If both chromosomes in a pair are acrocentric and have similar number of HOR arrays, then only repeats along the q-arm are used.
        * This is due to high recombination along the p-arms [1].

3. Partial contigs are checked by calculating the percentage of `ALR/Alpha` repeat types along the edges of the contig.
    * If the percentage is greater than a set threshold, the contig is considered partial.
    * If the above condition is not met, also check the length of the largest ALR repeat found.
        * If does not meet a set threshold, consider the contig as partial.
        * This handles edges cases for chr21 and chr22 contigs which have only have the q-arm which would meet the first condition but miss the central ALR.

4. The results for each pair are grouped by contig and merged/filtered depending on the metric.
    * Jaccard index
        * Select the pair with the **largest similarity index**.
    * Edit distance
        * Filter pairs with an **edit distance below the 30th percentile of all distances** and select the pair with the **lowest distance** from the filtered group.
        * We also calculate create a separate table with only pairs with matching chromosomes to use as a default pair if no pairs remain after filtering.

5. The results are joined by contig and determined by the following checks:
    * If *both jaccard index and edit distance agree*, the chromosome contig name is remapped to the reference chromosome. Its orientation is used.
    * If *neither metric agrees*, the chromosome contig name remains the same. The orientation is determined by the best match in the separate table with only pairs with matching chromosomes.
