# Dealing with API

Do not forget to follow the steps which are described in the example.ipynb file.

2. Run run_respondent.py
This will give an API link with which the users are going to complete the survey. 
3. Run run_business_owner_analysis.py
This will give an API link with which the business owner will be able to get the analysis conducted about their product.
