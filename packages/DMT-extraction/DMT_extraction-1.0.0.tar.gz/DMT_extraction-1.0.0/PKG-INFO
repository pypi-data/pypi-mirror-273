# DMT-extraction

Device-Modeling Toolkit (DMT) is a Python framework used for compact model parameter extraction. 
DMT-core is the main module that provides various routines useful for semiconductor device engineers that 
want to automate their infrastructure. 
DMT-extraction is an extension to DMT-core. 
DMT-extraction enables highly efficient compact model parameter extraction based on automated circuit simulation, 
evaluation of Verilog-A model equations and codes, and also a simple - yet powerful - GUI. 
DMT was featured at an Analog-Working-Group meeting in 2023, you can find the [Youtube video here](https://youtu.be/DAXjT2C0vsY?t=1024).

This project is funded by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/project/DMT-Core/) under the [NGI Zero Entrust fund](https://nlnet.nl/entrust/).

# Installation

Please make sure you have Python >3.8 installed. It is recommended to work in a virtual environment. 

## DMT-core and DMT-extraction

For using DMT-extraction, you must first install DMT-core and its dependencies. 
The installation is detailed [here](https://gitlab.com/dmt-development/dmt-core).

Once DMT-core is installed, you can use pip to install DMT-extraction, preferably in editor mode:

```
cd DMT_extraction
pip install -e .
```

## Ngspice Circuit Simulator

DMT-extraction uses ngspice as its circuit simulator, though interfaces to other circuit simulators are also implemented. 
Install ngspice as described on [its homepage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/). 
Afterward, you should be able to call 

```
ngspice
```

from the terminal. DMT-core will then be able to find the simulator. 

## Parameter Extraction GUI 

To run the parameter extraction GUI, a few dependencies that are not automatically installed with DMT-extraction are required. 
Those dependencies are:

- PySide2 or 6
- A working Texlive installation

The GUI window is defined by two files:
- The file main_window.ui was created with pyqt5-tools designer.
- The file main_window.py was created with the tool pyside2-uic from main_window.ui. 

# Test and Usage

The test cases in the test/ folder can be used to understand the purpose of DMT-extraction, but also to 
test the installation of DMT-extraction on your machine. 
Currently, we are working to implement a MOSFET model parameter extraction for the IHP open-source PDK, 
which will soon be available as a useful example for parameter extraction with DMT. 

# IHP Modeling example

We will use the [IHP SG13G2](https://www.ihp-microelectronics.com/events-1/detail/openpdk-opentooling-and-open-source-design-an-initiative-to-push-development) process as a reference.

Here we will soon link to IHP SG13G2 PSP modeling example project.

# PSP Compact Model for MOSFETs

DMT-extraction acknowledges the PSP model and its authors, which is supported for MOSFET compact modeling. 
The PSP model was by NXP Semiconductors, Delft University of Technology, and CEA Leti.

# PSP Model Parameter Extraction Literature

MOSFET parameter extraction is an involved topic, for which quite a bit of literature has been released. 
Below, a list of useful literature is given that is referenced in the code of this repository.
