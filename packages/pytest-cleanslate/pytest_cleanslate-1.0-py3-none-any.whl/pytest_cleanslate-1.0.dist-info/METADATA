## About
pytest-cleanslate is a small plugin for the [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)
test framework which, as the name implies, helps give each test module a "clean slate" to execute.
Plugins such as [pytest-forked](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked) and
[pytest-isolate](https://github.com/gilfree/pytest-isolate) allow you to execute tests
in separate processes, working around in-memory test "state pollution" resulting from
their execution, but do not protect against pollution caused by top-level code in test
modules. This is what pytest-CleanSlate remedies.
