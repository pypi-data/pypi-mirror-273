repeat_help_text = """Moore.io Repeat (!) Command
   Repeats last command ran by mio.  Currently only supports the `sim` command.
   
Usage:
   mio ! CMD [OPTIONS]
   
Options:
   -b, --bwrap  Does not run command, only creates shell script to re-create the command without mio and creates a
                tarball of the project outside the project root directory.  Currently only supports `sim` command.
   
Examples:
   mio sim uvmt_example -t rand_stim -s 1 ; mio ! sim -b  # Run a simulation for `uvmt_example` and create a tarball
                                                          # that can be run by anyone using only bash."""




sim_help_text = """Moore.io Sim(ulation) Command
   Performs necessary steps to run simulation of an IP.  Only supports Digital Logic Simulation for the time being.
   
   An optional target may be specified for the IP. Ex: my_ip#target.
   
   While the controls for individual steps (FuseSoC processing, compilation, elaboration and simulation) are exposed, it
   is recommended to let `mio sim` manage this process as much as possible.  In the event of corrupt simulator
   artifacts, see `mio clean`.  Combining any of the step-control arguments (-F, -C, -E, -S) with missing steps can
   result in unpredictable behavior and is not recommended (ex: `-FS` is illegal).
   
   Two types of arguments (--args) can be passed: compilation (+define+NAME[=VALUE]) and simulation (+NAME[=VALUE]).
   
   For running multiple tests in parallel, see `mio regr`.
   
Usage:
   mio sim IP [OPTIONS] [--args ARG ...]
   
Options:
   -t TEST     , --test      TEST       Specify the UVM test to be run.
   -s SEED     , --seed      SEED       Positive Integer. Specify randomization seed  If none is provided, a random one will be picked.
   -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY  Specifies UVM logging verbosity: none, low, medium, high, debug. [default: medium]
   -+ ARGS     , --args      ARGS       Specifies compilation-time (+define+ARG[=VAL]) or simulation-time (+ARG[=VAL]) arguments
   -e ERRORS   , --errors    ERRORS     Specifies the number of errors at which compilation/elaboration/simulation is terminated.  [default: 10]
   -a APP      , --app       APP        Specifies simulator application to use: viv, mdc, vcs, xcl, qst, riv. [default: viv]
   -w          , --waves                Enable wave capture to disk.
   -c          , --cov                  Enable code & functional coverage capture.
   -g          , --gui                  Invokes simulator in graphical or 'GUI' mode.
   
   -S   Simulate  target IP.
   -E   Elaborate target IP.
   -C   Compile   target IP.
   -F   Invoke FuseSoC to prepare core(s) for compilation.
   
Examples:
   mio sim my_ip -t smoke -s 1 -w -c             # Compile, elaborate and simulate test 'my_ip_smoke_test_c'
