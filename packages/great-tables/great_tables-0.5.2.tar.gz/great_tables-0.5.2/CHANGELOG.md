## `great_tables v0.0.2`

This release contains fairly comprehensive implementations of a top-level `GT` object, with...

* Reasonably featureful `fmt_*` methods

* Methods for titles, subtitles, and table notes

* Internal work for implementing spanners, and row and group columns (in a future release).
