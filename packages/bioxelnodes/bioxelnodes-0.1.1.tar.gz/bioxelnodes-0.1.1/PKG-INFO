Bioxel Nodes is a Blender add-on for scientific volumetric data visualization. It using Blender's powerful Geometry Nodes | Cycles to process and render volumetric data.

# About

Before us, there have been many tutorials and add-ons for importing volumetric data into Blender. However, we found that there were many details that were not addressed in place, some scientific facts were ignored, and the volume rendering was not pretty enough. With Bioxel Nodes, you can easily import the volumetric data into Blender, and more importantly, it can quickly make a beautiful realistic rendering of it.

Below are some examples with Bioxel Nodes. Thanks to Cycles Render, the volumetric data can be rendered with great detail:

The "Bioxel" in "BioxelNodes", is a combination of the words "Bio-" and "Voxel". Bioxel is a voxel that stores biological data. The volumetric data made up of Bioxel is called Bioxels. We are developing a toolkit around Bioxels for better biological data visualization. but before its release, we made this Blender version of bioxels toolkit first, in order to let more people to have fun with volumetric data.
