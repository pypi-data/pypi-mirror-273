# dllist

A very small Python library to list the DLLs loaded by the current process.
This is equivalent to the [`dllist`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Libdl/#Base.Libc.Libdl.dllist) function in Julia.

*Note*: This library is tested on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Some platforms which provide the same API as Linux (e.g. FreeBSD) may also work.

Any other platform will return an empty list and raise a warning.

## Installation

`dllist` is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dllist/):

```
pip install dllist
```

## Usage

```python
import dllist
print(dllist.dllist())
# ['linux-vdso.so.1', '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0', '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2', ...
```

*Note*: The library paths are not postprocessed by this library. Depending on your usage, you may need to convert them to absolute paths and/or perform case-normalization (Windows).
