# Learn

Pynxtools-apm offers the atom probe community a set of diverse example how a parser can be implemented to provide for a diverse and wide coverage of the (meta)data from the research field of atom probe and field-ion microscopy. We would like to encourage the community to share example files with us. These can be small and come from diverse use cases.

We are working together with the [International Field Emission Society's (IFES) Atom Probe Technical Committee (APT TC)](https://fieldemission.org/article.php?id=technical_committee) to improve the capabilities of the reader for the benefit of all
atom probers.
