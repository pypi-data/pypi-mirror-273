# Enable temperature calibration
# Enable the use of temperature calibration parameters for this IMU. For automatic learning set to 2 and

# Temperature calibration max
# The maximum temperature that the calibration is valid for. This must be at least 10 degrees above TMIN

# Log bitmask
# Bitmap of what on-board log types to enable. This value is made up of the sum of each of the log types
# you want to be saved. It is usually best just to enable all basiclog types by setting this to 65535.

# Enable logging while disarmed
# If LOG_DISARMED is set to 1 then logging will be enabled at all times including when disarmed. Logging
# before arming can make for very large logfiles but can help a lot when tracking down startup issues and
# is necessary if logging of EKF replay data is selected via the LOG_REPLAY parameter. If LOG_DISARMED is
# set to 2, then logging will be enabled when disarmed, but not if a USB connection is detected. This can
# be used to prevent unwanted data logs being generated when the vehicle is connected via USB for log
# downloading or parameter changes. If LOG_DISARMED is set to 3 then logging will happen while disarmed,
# but if the vehicle never arms then the logs using the filesystem backend will be discarded on the next
# boot.
# 0: Disabled
# 1: Enabled
# 2: Disabled on USB connection
# 3: Discard log on reboot if never armed
# Default: 0
LOG_DISARMED,1 # to gather data for the offline IMU temperature compensation while the FC is disarmed
