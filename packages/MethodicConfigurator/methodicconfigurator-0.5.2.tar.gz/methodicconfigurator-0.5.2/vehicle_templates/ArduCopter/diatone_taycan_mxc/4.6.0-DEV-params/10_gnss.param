# Sets default state of the safety switch
# This controls the default state of the safety switch at startup. When set to 1 the safety switch will
# start in the safe state (flashing) at boot. When set to zero the safety switch will start in the unsafe
# state (solid) at startup. Note that if a safety switch is fitted the user can still control the safety
# state after startup using the switch. The safety state can also be controlled in software using a MAVLink
# message.
