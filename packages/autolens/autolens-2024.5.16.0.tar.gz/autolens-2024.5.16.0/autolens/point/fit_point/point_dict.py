        """
        A fit to a point source dataset, which is stored as a dictionary containing the fit of every data point in a
        entire point-source dataset dictionary.

        This dictionary uses the `name` of the `PointDataset` to act as the key of every entry of the dictionary,
        making it straight forward to access the attributes based on the dataset name.

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_dict
            A dictionary of all point-source datasets that are to be fitted.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict
            A dictionary where the keys are the `name` entries of each dataset in the `PointDict` and the values
            are the corresponding fits to the `PointDataset` it contained.
