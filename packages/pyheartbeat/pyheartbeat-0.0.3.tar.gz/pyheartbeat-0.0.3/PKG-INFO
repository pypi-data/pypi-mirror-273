# Python Heartbeat Library

The Python Heartbeat Library is a simple utility that allows you to send regular "pulses" to a specific endpoint. These pulses serve as confirmation that your main script is functioning correctly. If the main script stops for any reason, the heartbeat will also cease, indicating that something went wrong.

# Installation

You can install the Python Heartbeat Library using pip:

pip install pyheartbeat

# Example

```python
======================================================================================================
from pyheartbeat import setUrl, heartbeat, killHeartbeat

# Set the URL for sending pulses
setUrl("https://your_url")

# Start the heartbeat with a pulse every x seconds
heartbeat(interval = 600, name = 'process name', description = 'process description', additional_info = 'additional info', show_response = True, show_logs = True)

# Your main script logic goes here...

# When your script ends or encounters an error, stop the heartbeat
killHeartbeat()
======================================================================================================
```
