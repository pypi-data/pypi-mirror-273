# Test Modules for Klingon File Manager

This directory contains the test modules for the `klingon_file_manager`
package. Each test file focusses on different aspects of the system's functionality.
Together, these tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the file
manager across various operations involving AWS credentials, bucket
permissions, MIME type checking, and RESTful API operations.

## Modules Overview

- [`test_utils_aws_credentials`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_utils_aws_credentials.html): Tests for the retrieval and validation of AWS credentials, simulating various scenarios like missing or invalid keys.
- [`test_utils_parallel_check_bucket_permissions`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_utils_parallel_check_bucket_permissions.html): Ensures that the bucket permissions are checked in parallel correctly and handles different permission sets.
- [`test_utils_check_bucket_permissions`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_utils_check_bucket_permissions.html): Verifies individual AWS S3 bucket permissions, handling both existing and non-existing buckets.
- [`test_utils_get_mime_type`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_utils_get_mime_type.html): Confirms the ability to accurately determine the MIME type of files, both locally and within AWS S3.
- [`test_post`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_post.html): Tests for the `post_file` function, as well as its helper functions `_post_to_s3` and `_post_to_local` from the `klingon_file_manager.post` module.
- [`test_get`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_get.html): Tests for the `get_file` function, as well as its helper functions `_get_from_s3` and `_get_from_local` from the `klingon_file_manager.get` module.
- [`test_move_file`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_move_file.html): Tests for the `move_file` function from the `klingon_file_manager.manage` module.
- [`test_delete`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_delete.html): These modules validate the RESTful API operations for creating, retrieving, and deleting resources respectively.
- [`test_functional_tests`](/klingon_file_manager/tests/test_functional_tests.html): Contains end-to-end functional tests that simulate user interaction with the file manager to verify the integrated operation of all components.

Each module is equipped with mock functions and fixtures to simulate the AWS environment and HTTP interactions, ensuring tests run in isolation without the need for actual AWS resources or live servers. They are designed to be comprehensive and cover various edge cases and error conditions.
