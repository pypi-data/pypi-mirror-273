        This Function Performs Sampling part and generate samples of Requiared random variables
        
        It is very important that pay attention that any sampling of objects only should be done here
        And they should be store in objects variables and anywhere that we need them to avoid any mistake 
        Just use the sampled values and do not generate them agian that is wrong (Obviously in any Monte Carlo simulation only one time we can do sampling)
