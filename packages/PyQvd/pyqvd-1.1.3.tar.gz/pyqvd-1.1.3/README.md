# PyQvd

> Utility library for reading/writing Qlik View Data (QVD) files in Python.

The _PyQvd_ library provides a simple API for reading/writing Qlik View Data (QVD) files in Python.
Using this library, it is possible to parse the binary QVD file format and convert it to a Python object
structure or vice versa.

## Install

_PyQvd_ is a Python library available through [pypi](https://pypi.org/). The recommended way to install and maintain _PyQvd_ as a dependency is through the package installer (PIP). Before installing this library, download and install Python.

You can get _PyQvd_ using the following command:

```bash
pip install PyQvd
```

## Usage

Below is a quick example how to use _PyQvd_.

```python
from pyqvd import QvdDataFrame

df = QvdDataFrame.from_qvd('sample.qvd')
print(df.head(5))
```

The above example loads the _PyQvd_ library and parses an example QVD file. A QVD file is typically loaded using the static
`QvdDataFrame.from_qvd` function of the `QvdDataFrame` class itself. After loading the file's content, numerous methods and properties are available to work with the parsed data.

## QVD File Format

The QVD file format is a binary file format that is used by QlikView to store data. The format is proprietary. However,
the format is well documented and can be parsed without the need of a QlikView installation. In fact, a QVD file consists
of three parts: a XML header, and two binary parts, the symbol and the index table. The XML header contains meta information
about the QVD file, such as the number of data records and the names of the fields. The symbol table contains the actual
distinct values of the fields. The index table contains the actual data records. The index table is a list of indices
which point to values in the symbol table.

### XML Header

The XML header contains meta information about the QVD file. The header is always located at the beginning of the file and
is in human readable text format. The header contains information about the number of data records, the names of the fields,
and the data types of the fields.

### Symbol Table

The symbol table contains the distinct/unique values of the fields and is located directly after the XML header. The order
of columns in the symbol table corresponds to the order of the fields in the XML header. The length and offset of the
symbol sections of each column are also stored in the XML header. Each symbol section consist of the unique symbols of the
respective column. The type of a single symbol is determined by a type byte prefixed to the respective symbol value. The
following type of symbols are supported:

| Code | Type         | Description                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Integer      | signed 4-byte integer (little endian)                                                         |
| 2    | Float        | signed 8-byte IEEE floating point number (little endian)                                      |
| 4    | String       | null terminated string                                                                        |
| 5    | Dual Integer | signed 4-byte integer (little endian) followed by a null terminated string                    |
| 6    | Dual Float   | signed 8-byte IEEE floating point number (little endian) followed by a null terminated string |

### Index Table

After the symbol table, the index table follows. The index table contains the actual data records. The index table contains
binary indices that refrences to the values of each row in the symbol table. The order of the columns in the index table
corresponds to the order of the fields in the XML header. Hence, the index table does not contain the actual values of a
data record, but only the indices that point to the values in the symbol table.

## API Documentation

### QvdDataFrame

The `QvdDataFrame` class represents the data frame stored inside of a finally parsed QVD file. It provides a high-level abstraction access to the QVD file content. This includes meta information as well as access to the actual data records.

| Property  | Type              | Description                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shape`   | `tuple[int, int]` | The shape of the data frame. First value is number of rows, second value number of columns. |
| `data`    | `list[list[any]]` | The actual data. The first dimension represents the single rows.                            |
| `columns` | `list[str]`       | The names of the fields that are contained in the QVD file.                                 |

#### `@staticmethod from_qvd(path: str) -> QvdDataFrame`

The static method `QvdDataFrame.from_qvd` loads a QVD file from the given path and parses it. The method returns a `QvdDataFrame` instance.

#### `@staticmethod from_stream(source: BinaryIO) -> QvdDataFrame`

The static method `QvdDataFrame.from_stream` loads a QVD file from the given binary stream. The method returns a `QvdDataFrame` instance.

#### `@staticmethod from_dict(data: Dict[str, List[any]]) -> QvdDataFrame`

The static method `QvdDataFrame.from_dict` constructs a data frame from a dictionary. The dictionary must contain the columns and the actual data as properties. The columns property is an array of strings that contains the names of the fields in the QVD file. The data property is an array of arrays that contains the actual data records. The order of the values in the inner arrays corresponds to the order of the fields in the QVD file.

#### `@staticmethod from_pandas(data: pandas.DataFrame) -> QvdDataFrame`

The static method `QvdDataFrame.from_pandas` constructs a data frame from a pandas data frame.

#### `head(n: int) -> QvdDataFrame`

The method `head` returns the first `n` rows of the data frame.

#### `tail(n: int) -> QvdDataFrame`

The method `tail` returns the last `n` rows of the data frame.

#### `select(*args: str) -> QvdDataFrame`

The method `select` returns a new data frame that contains only the specified columns.

#### `rows(*args: int) -> QvdDataFrame`

The method `rows` returns a new data frame that contains only the specified rows.

#### `at(row: int, column: str) -> any`

The method `at` returns the value at the specified row and column.

#### `to_dict() -> Dict[str, List[any]]`

The method `to_dict` returns the data frame as a dictionary. The dictionary contains the columns and the actual data as properties. The columns property is an array of strings that contains the names of the fields in the QVD file. The data property is an array of arrays that contains the actual data records. The order of the values in the inner arrays corresponds to the order of the fields in the QVD file.

#### `to_qvd(path: str) -> None`

The method `to_qvd` writes the data frame to a QVD file at the specified path.

#### `to_stream(target: BinaryIO) -> None`

The method `to_stream` writes the data frame as a QVD file to a binary stream.

#### `to_pandas() -> pandas.DataFrame`
