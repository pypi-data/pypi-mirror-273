# phenopype-plugins

AI-plugins for [phenopype](https://www.phenopype.org/) - currently under development. 

Currently, three plugin functions are available - all of them do image segmentation using pre-trained models:

 - predict_fastSAM (Fast Segment Anything: https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/fast-sam/) - needs `ultralytics`
 - predict_torch (Torchvision segmentation models: https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models.html) - needs `torch`
 - predict_keras (Keras segmentation models https://keras.io/examples/vision/oxford_pets_image_segmentation/) - needs `keras`

## Installation

1\. Install phenopype (see https://www.phenopype.org/docs/installation/phenopype/ for more details): 

    pip install phenopype

2\. Install the plugins module:

    pip install phenopype-plugins

3\. Install the dependencies

## Dependencies

If you have a GPU and the appropriate drivers install, make sure you install a fitting CUDA version first - e.g., v12.1:

    pip install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit==12.1

### `torch`

1\. With GPU support:

    pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

2\. Without GPU support:

    pip install torch torchvision

### `keras`

1\. With GPU support:

    pip install keras-gpu

2. Without GPU support:

    pip install keras-gpu


### `ultralytics`

1\. Install Ultralytics BEFORE phenopype due to conflicting opencv-python (ultralytics) and opencv-contrib-python (phenopype) versions (see step 2 for alternatives):

 
    pip install torch torchvision ## needed
    pip install ultralytics

2\. If you have already installed phenopype and can't or don't want to uninstall it, you can do the following:
    
    pip install ultralytics

    ## force reinstall opencv-contrib-python
    pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.2.54 --force-reinstall
