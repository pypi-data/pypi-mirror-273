'''
Used to house useful objects for storage schemas (e.g., SQLAlchemy table definitions).
Provides a general interface for mapping from CO3 class names to storage structures for
auto-collection and composition.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    mapper = Mapper[sa.Table]()
    
    mapper.attach(
        Type,
        attr_comp=TypeTable,
        coll_comp=CollateTable,
        coll_groups={
            'name': NameConversions
        }
    )

.. admonition:: Development log

    - Overruled design decision: Mappers were previously designed to map from a specific
      CO3 hierarchy to a specific Schema. The intention was to allow only related types to
      be attached to a single schema, at least under a particular Mapper. The type
      restriction has since been removed, however, as it isn't particularly well-founded.
      During ``collect()``, a particular instance collects data from both its attributes and
      its collation actions. It then repeats the same upward for parent types (part of the
      same type hierarchy), and down to components (often not part of the same type
      hierarchy). As such, to fully collect from a type, the Mapper needs to leave
      registration open to various types, not just those part of the same hierarchy.

    '''
    Mapper base class for housing schema components and managing relationships between CO3
    types and storage components (of type C).

    Mappers are responsible for two primary tasks:

    1. Attaching CO3 types to database Components from within a single schema
    2. Facilitating collection of Component-related insertion data from instances of
       attached CO3 types

    Additionally, the Mapper manages its own Collector and Composer instances. The
    Collector receives the inserts from ``.collect()`` calls, and will subsequently be
    "dropped off" at an appropriate Database's Manager to actually perform the requested
    inserts (hence why we tie Mappers to Schemas one-to-one). 

    .. admonition:: Dev note

        The Composer needs reconsideration, or at least its positioning directly in this
        class. It may be more appropriate to have at the Schema level, or even just
        dissolved altogether if arbitrary named Components can be attached to schemas.

    '''
    .. admonition:: class design

        Heavily debating between multiple possible design approaches here. The main
        purpose of this subtype is make clear the need for additional compositional
        mapping details, namely functions that can produce pairwise join conditions for
        both the attribute tree (vertical traversal) and the collation components
        (horizontal traversal). Here's a few remarks:

        - I want the necessary maps to provided/stored *outside* of ``compose`` calls to
          reduce overhead for downstream callers. It's awkward to have think about the
          exact attr-to-attr associations each time you want a type's associated
          composition, especially when they don't change under the same Mapper (i.e.,
          if you have the Mapper reference, the compositional associations should be
          implicit).
        - The barebones spec here appears to be two pairwise "composer" maps: one for
          attribute comps, and one for collation comps. For now I think this makes sense
          as additional init params, but there may later be reason to wrap this up a bit
          more.
        - Considering the full deprecation for the Composer type, or whether this could be
          the place where it serves some purpose. Aesthetically, there's symmetry with the
          ``collect`` and Collector method-type pairing, but that isn't a good enough reason
          to justify a separate type here. The difference is that Collector instances
          actually store type references, whereas the considered Composer type would
          effectively just be a convenient collection of utility functions. Still possibly
          useful, but not as clearly justifiable.
        - If a separate Composer type were to be justified here, it would serve as a
          "reusable connective tissue" for possibly many Mappers with the same kinds of
          edge-wise relationships. Can think of it like this:

          * Schemas collect up "nodes" (Components). These are explicit storage structures
            in a DB, and can include some explicit attribute connections (foreign keys),
            although those are connections made on the DB side.
          * Mappers provide an exoskeleton for a Schema's nodes. It structures Components into
            attributes and collation types, and additionally ties them to external CO3
            types. The handy analogy here has been that attribute comps connect
            *vertically* (in a tree like fashion; point up for parents and down for
            children), and collation comps point *horizontally* (or perhaps more aptly,
            *outward*; at each node in the attribute tree, you have a "circle" of
            collation comps that can point to it, and are not involved as formal tree
            nodes. Can maybe think of these like "ornaments" or bulbs or orbitals).
          * While the Mappers may provide the "bones," there's no way to communicate
            *across* them. While I might know that one attribute is the "parent" of
            another, I don't know *why* that relationship is there. A Composer, or the
            composer details to be provided to this class, serve as the "nerves" to be
            paired with the bone, actually establishing a line of communication. More
            specifically, the nerves here are attribute-based mappings between pairs of
            Components, i.e., (generalized) join conditions.

        - Note that, by the above logic, we should then want/need a type to manage the
          functions provided to ``attach_many``. These functions help automatically
          characterize the shape of the type skeleton in the same way the proposed
          Composer wrapper would. In fact, the barebones presentation here is really just
          the same two function signatures as are expected by that method. The above
          analogy simply made me ask why the "bones" wouldn't be reusable if the "nerves"
          were going to be. So we should perhaps coordinate a decision on this front; if
          one goes, the other must as well. This may also help me keep it simpler for the
          time being.
        - One other aspect of a dedicated Composer type (and by the above point, a
          hypothetical type to aid in ``attach_many`` specification) could have some sort of
          "auto" feature about it. With a clear enough "discovery system," we could
          encourage certain kinds of Schemas and components are named and structured. Such
          an auto-composer could "scan" all components in a provided Schema and attempt to
          find common attributes across tables that are unlinked (i.e., the reused
          column names implicit across types in the attribute hierarchy; e.g., File.name
          -> Note.name), as well as explicit connections which may suggest collation
          attachment (e.g., ``note_conversions.name --FK-> Note.name``). This, of course,
          could always be overridden with manual specification, but being aware of some
          automatic discovery structures could help constrain schema definitions to be
          more in-line with the CO3 operational model. That all being said, this is a
          large amount of complexity and should likely be avoided until necessary.
