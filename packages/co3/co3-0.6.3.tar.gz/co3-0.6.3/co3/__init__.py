Database submodule

- ``db``: contains SQLAlchemy-based schema definitions
- ``accessors``: convenience methods for accessing database entries
- ``populate``: convenience methods for populating database tables

The ``accessors`` and ``populate`` submodules are each split into ``schema`` and ``fts`` method
groups. The former concerns methods relating to the actual database schema, the latter to
their SQLite FTS counterparts.

.. admonition:: Subpackages organization

    Subpackages are broken up by inheritance. Within a given submodule, you have a
    ``_base.py`` file defining the base class associated with that submodule's title, along
    with concrete subclasses of that base in their own files. Deeper inheritance would
    recursively extend this structure. The ``__init__.py`` for a given submodule then
    exposes the concrete instances, leaving the base hidden. For example,

    .. code-block::

        accessors/
            _base.py
            core.py
            fts.py

    ``core`` and ``fts`` house the ``CoreAccessor`` and ``FTSAccessor`` classes, respectively,
    and are the direct subclasses of the ``Accessor`` parent found in the ``_base``. This base
    class *could* be placed outside of the submodule in the parent directory (imported
    with something like ``from db import accessor`` instead of ``from db.accessor import
    _base``). This is entirely valid, but I tend to prefer when the base class is among its
    direct children, as

    - In this case at least, the base doesn't need to be exposed
    - The base class is being stowed away under an appropriately named submodule; having a
      separate ``accessor.py`` and ``accessors/`` file/directory can feel a little cluttered.
    - It makes imports across the accessors feel standardized:

      .. code-block:: python
    
          from localsys.db.accessors._base import Accessor
    
          from localsys.db.accessors.core import CoreAccessor

      Both have the same level of nesting to reach the class.

    Frankly, both means of organization are perfectly fine, and as far as I can tell,
    semantically sound in their own right. This particular scheme is just a preference in
    the moment, and so long as I keep things consistent, choosing one over the other
    shouldn't matter.

    Additionally, note how ``__init__.py``s are typically set up when providing wider access
    to internal modules. The ``init`` typically pulls out classes from sibling modules
    (i.e., files), but will import subpackages are the topmost level. For example, for the
    structure

    .. code-block::

        db/
            __init__.py
            accessors/
                __init__.py
                _base.py
                core.py
                fts.py

    we have

    .. code-block::
       :name: db/__init__.py

        from localsys.db import accessors

    which just imports the subpackage ``accessors``. However, within subpackage:

    .. code-block::
       :name: db/accessors/__init__.py

        from localsys.db.accessors.core import CoreAccessor

    we don't just import the submodule ``core``; we did into the file to grab the relevant
    class and pull it into the outer namespace. Overarching point: ``__init__.py`` files
    typically reach into the sibling files (submodules) and pull out classes. Given that
    this behavior is recursive, ``__init__.py`` then respect subpackages (nested
    directories), importing them at the top-level and expecting an internal ``__init__.py``
    will have managed access appropriately.

.. admonition:: Organization for inheritance over composition

    At a glance, the organization of subpackages here feels like it clashes with those
    seen in ``localsys.primitives``. ``note_components``, for instance, houses the components
    for the outer ``note`` module. Contrast this with how the ``core`` submodule looks: it's
    composing ``*/core.py`` files across subpackages ``accessors`` and ``managers``, rather than
    a single subpackage like ``note``. This seems inconsistent, but the subpackages here are
    actually still organized in the same way: by inheritance. It just happens that the
    all of the note components inherit from the same base class, and are thus confined to
    a single subpackage. This aside, the subpackages themselves are still created around
    inheritance, wrapping up a base and direct subclasses.
