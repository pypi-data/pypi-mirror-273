# More Collections

Some useful data structures for collections of data


### Class `Index`

Provide indexing for a list. Inner properties can be used for keys, and keys can be tuples of properties.  

### Class `UniqueIndex`

Same as Index, but includes checks and optimization to ensure members' keys are unique.

### Class `Queue`

A `Queue` is a list, with `add()` and `pop()`. It ensures members in the queue are not duplicated by not adding the ones already found in the queue.

### Class `Matrix`

A multidimensional grid of values that can be used like a `Mapping` from a-tuple-of-coordinates to the value at that coordinate. Plus a few other convenience methods.

This is a naive implementation. The hope it is a simple facade to a faster implementation.

### Class `Relation`

Store the many-to-many relations between two domains
