# Installing

If you've already set up a Python virtual environment, you can also install the stable library manually from PyPi:

```
pip install drv2605
```

Otherwise our install script will set one up for you.

Stable library from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/drv2605-python
cd drv2605-python
./install.sh
```

Latest/development library from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/drv2605-python
cd drv2605-python
./install.sh --unstable
```

**Note** Libraries will be installed in the "pimoroni" virtual environment, you will need to activate it to run examples:

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/pimoroni/bin/activate
```

# Vibration Patterns
