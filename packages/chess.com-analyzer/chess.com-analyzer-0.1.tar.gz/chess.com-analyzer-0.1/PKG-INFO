![ChessDotComLogo](https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/phpNgJfyb.png)

`Chess.com Analyzer` is a Python package for analyzing chess games played on Chess.com and retrieving detailed analysis results using the Stockfish 16 NNUE engine. Unlike the Chess.com platform, `Chess Analyzer` is completely free, allowing you to analyze chess games without any cost.

## Features

- 🔍 Analyze chess games played on Chess.com (because who wants to pay for that?).
- 📊 Retrieve game analysis results including move tallies (for the thrifty chess enthusiast).
- 📅 Fetch game numbers and corresponding opponents for a specific user in a given month and year (all without spending a dime!).

## Installation

You can install `Chess.com Analyzer` using pip:

```bash
pip install chess.com-analyzer
```

## Usage

```python
from chess.com_analyzer import ChessAnalyzer

# Initialize a ChessAnalyzer instance
analyzer = ChessAnalyzer()

# Get game numbers and corresponding opponents for a user in a specified month and year
games_info = analyzer.get_game_number("username", year="2024", month="5")

# Analyze a specific game played by the user
game_analysis = analyzer.analyze_game("username", game_number=0, year="2024", month="5")

# Print the analysis results
print(game_analysis)
```
