# markdown_include

This is a simple Python script that processes Markdown files by including the contents of other Markdown files.

The script takes in a Markdown file as input, looks for lines that are similar to `<!-- include (filename) -->` (Parentheses are necessary to identify the path) and treats them as include directives. For each include directive, the script reads the specified file and writes its contents to the output file. The result is a new Markdown file that includes the contents of all included files.

## Usage

To use the script, simply pass the input file name and the output file name as command-line arguments. The script will process the input file, generate the output file, and exit. Here's an example of how to run the script:

```shell
md_incl input_file.md output_file.md
```

This script will be added as a command to the `$PATH` for direct invocation

## Features

+ Processes Markdown files by including the contents of other Markdown files
+ Supports include directives in the format of `<!-- include (filename) -->` (Parentheses are necessary to identify the path)
+ Outputs a new Markdown file that includes the contents of the included files
+ Takes in input and output file names as command-line arguments

## Requirements

+ `>Python 3.5`
+ A text editor to modify the input and included files

## Installation

To use this script, simply download the file and save it to your computer. You can use `pip` to install the command

```shell
pip3 install .
```

It could be used in some building system like `Makefile`, which allows for the automatic assembly of large and complex reports and papers.
