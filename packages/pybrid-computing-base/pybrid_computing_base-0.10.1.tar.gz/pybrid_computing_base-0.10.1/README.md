# pybrid-computing-base: The python hybrid computing code basics

*pybrid* is a code that provides an interface to configure and control analog computers,
in particular the network-enabled LUCIDAC/REDAC analog-digital hybrid computers made by
[anabrid](https://anabrid.com/).

The `pybrid-computing-base` package contains the common base abstractions for analog and hybrid
functionality, entities, algorithms and similar constructs.

These are used as bases for the concrete implementations in the platform-specific
packages to provide an interface for other shared abstractions.

This package/repository is not supposed to be used directly.
See [pybrid-computing](https://pypi.org/project/pybrid-computing/) for the high level package
and in particular for the README how to use, install and edit this code.
