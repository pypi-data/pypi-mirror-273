Modeling
========

We can use a galaxies to fit data of a galaxy and quantify its goodness-of-fit via a *log_likelihood*.

Of course, when we observe an image of a galaxy, we have no idea what combination of galaxies and light profiles
will produce a model-image that looks like the galaxy we observed:

The task of finding these galaxies and light profiles is called *modeling*.

PyAutoFit
---------

Modeling uses the probabilistic programming language
`PyAutoFit <https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit>`_, an open-source Python framework that allows complex model
fitting techniques to be straightforwardly integrated into scientific modeling software. Check it out if you
are interested in developing your own software to perform advanced model-fitting!

We import it separately to **PyAutoGalaxy**

.. code-block:: python

    import autofit as af

Model Composition
-----------------

We compose the model that we fit to the data using a ``Model`` object, which behaves analogously to the ``Galaxy``,
and ``LightProfile`` used previously, however their parameters are not specified and are instead
determined by a fitting procedure.

.. code-block:: python

    galaxy = af.Model(
        ag.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, bulge=ag.lp.Sersic, disk=ag.lp.Exponential
    )

We put the model galaxy above into a `Collection`, which is the model we will fit. Note how we could easily 
extend this object to compose complex models containing many galaxies.

The reason we create separate `Collection`'s for the `galaxies` and `model` is so that the `model`
can be extended to include other components than just galaxies.

.. code-block:: python

    galaxies = af.Collection(galaxy=galaxy)
    model = af.Collection(galaxies=galaxies)

In this example we therefore fit a model where:

 - The galaxy's bulge is a parametric `Sersic` bulge [7 parameters].
 - The galaxy's disk is a parametric `Exponential` disk [6 parameters].

The redshifts of the galaxy (z=0.5) is fixed.

Printing the ``info`` attribute of the model shows us this is the model we are fitting, and shows us the free
parameters and their priors:

.. code-block:: python

    print(model.info)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

                effective_radius                       UniformPrior, lower_limit = 0.0, upper_limit = 30.0

Non-linear Search
-----------------

We now choose the non-linear search, which is the fitting method used to determine the set of `LightProfile` (e.g.
bulge and disk) parameters that best-fit our data.

In this example we use `dynesty` (https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty), a nested sampling algorithm that is
very effective at modeling.

.. code-block:: python

    search = af.Nautilus(name="search_example")

**PyAutoGalaxy** supports many model-fitting algorithms, including maximum likelihood estimators and MCMC, which are
documented throughout the workspace.

Analysis
--------

We next create an ``AnalysisImaging`` object, which contains the ``log likelihood function`` that the non-linear
search calls to fit the model to the data.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis = ag.AnalysisImaging(dataset=dataset)


Run Times
---------

modeling can be a computationally expensive process. When fitting complex models to high resolution datasets
run times can be of order hours, days, weeks or even months.

Run times are dictated by two factors:

 - The log likelihood evaluation time: the time it takes for a single ``instance`` of the model to be fitted to
   the dataset such that a log likelihood is returned.

 - The number of iterations (e.g. log likelihood evaluations) performed by the non-linear search: more complex lens
   models require more iterations to converge to a solution.

The log likelihood evaluation time can be estimated before a fit using the ``profile_log_likelihood_function`` method,
which returns two dictionaries containing the run-times and information about the fit.

.. code-block:: python

    run_time_dict, info_dict = analysis.profile_log_likelihood_function(
        instance=model.random_instance()
    )

The overall log likelihood evaluation time is given by the ``fit_time`` key.

For this example, it is ~0.01 seconds, which is extremely fast for modeling. More advanced lens
modeling features (e.g. shapelets, multi Gaussian expansions, pixelizations) have slower log likelihood evaluation
times (1-3 seconds), and you should be wary of this when using these features.

The ``run_time_dict`` has a break-down of the run-time of every individual function call in the log likelihood
function, whereas the ``info_dict`` stores information about the data which drives the run-time (e.g. number of
image-pixels in the mask, the shape of the PSF, etc.).

.. code-block:: python

    print(f"Log Likelihood Evaluation Time (second) = {run_time_dict['fit_time']}")

This gives an output of ~0.01 seconds.

To estimate the expected overall run time of the model-fit we multiply the log likelihood evaluation time by an
estimate of the number of iterations the non-linear search will perform.

Estimating this quantity is more tricky, as it varies depending on the model complexity (e.g. number of parameters)
and the properties of the dataset and model being fitted.

For this example, we conservatively estimate that the non-linear search will perform ~10000 iterations per free
parameter in the model. This is an upper limit, with models typically converge in far fewer iterations.

If you perform the fit over multiple CPUs, you can divide the run time by the number of cores to get an estimate of
the time it will take to fit the model. Parallelization with Nautilus scales well, it speeds up the model-fit by the
``number_of_cores`` for N < 8 CPUs and roughly ``0.5*number_of_cores`` for N > 8 CPUs. This scaling continues
for N> 50 CPUs, meaning that with super computing facilities you can always achieve fast run times!

.. code-block:: python

    print(
        "Estimated Run Time Upper Limit (seconds) = ",
        (run_time_dict["fit_time"] * model.total_free_parameters * 10000)
        / search.number_of_cores,
    )

Model-Fit
---------

To perform the model-fit we pass the model and analysis to the search's fit method. This will output results (e.g.,
dynesty samples, model parameters, visualization) to hard-disk.

.. code-block:: python

    result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

The non-linear search fits the model by guessing many models over and over iteratively, using the models which
give a good fit to the data to guide it where to guess subsequent model. 

An animation of a non-linear search is shown below, although this is for a strong gravitational using
**PyAutoGalaxy**'s child project **PyAutoLens**. Updating the animation for a galaxy is on the **PyAutoGalaxy**
to-do list!

We can see that initial models give a poor fit to the data but gradually improve (increasing the likelihood) as more
iterations are performed.

Results
-------

Once a model-fit is running, **PyAutoGalaxy** outputs the results of the search to hard-disk on-the-fly. This includes
model parameter estimates with errors non-linear samples and the visualization of the best-fit model inferred
by the search so far.

The fit above returns a ``Result`` object, which includes lots of information on the model. 

The ``info`` attribute can be printed to give the results in a readable format:

.. code-block:: python

    print(result_list.info)

This gives the following output:

This result contains the full posterior information of our non-linear search, including all
parameter samples, log likelihood values and tools to compute the errors on the model.

This is contained in the ``Samples`` object. Below, we show how to print the median PDF parameter estimates, but
many different results are available and illustrated in the `results package of the workspace <https://github.com/Jammy2211/autogalaxy_workspace/tree/release/notebooks/results>`_.

    print(median_pdf_instance, "\n")
    print(median_pdf_instance.galaxies.galaxy.bulge)
    print()

**PyAutoGalaxy** includes many visualization tools for plotting the results of a non-linear search, for example we can
make a corner plot of the probability density function (PDF):

.. code-block:: python

    plotter = aplt.NestPlotter(samples=result.samples)
    plotter.corner_cornerpy()

Here is an example of how a PDF estimated for a model appears:

The result also contains the maximum log likelihood ``Galaxies`` and ``FitImaging`` objects and which can easily be
plotted.

.. code-block:: python

    galaxies_plotter = aplt.GalaxiesPlotter(galaxies=result.max_log_likelihood_galaxies, grid=mask.derive_grid.masked)

Here's what the model-fit of the model which maximizes the log likelihood looks like, providing good residuals and
low chi-squared values:

The package ``autogalaxy_workspace/*/results`` contains a full description of all information contained
in a ``Result``.

Model Customization
-------------------

The ``Model`` can be fully customized, making it simple to parameterize and fit many different models
using any combination of light profiles:

.. code-block:: python

    galaxy_model = af.Model(
        ag.Galaxy,
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=ag.lp.DevVaucouleurs,
        disk = ag.lp.Sersic,
        bar=ag.lp.Gaussian,
        clump_0=ag.lp.ElsonFreeFall,
        clump_1=ag.lp.ElsonFreeFall,
    )

    """
    This aligns the bulge and disk centres in the galaxy model, reducing the
    number of free parameter fitted for by Dynesty by 2.
    """
    galaxy_model.bulge.centre = galaxy_model.disk.centre

    """
    This fixes the galaxy bulge light profile's effective radius to a value of
    0.8 arc-seconds, removing another free parameter.
    """
    galaxy_model.bulge.effective_radius = 0.8

    """
    This forces the light profile disk's effective radius to be above 3.0.
    """
    galaxy_model.bulge.add_assertion(galaxy_model.disk.effective_radius > 3.0)

Linear Light Profiles
---------------------

**PyAutoGalaxy** supports 'linear light profiles', where the ``intensity`` parameters of all parametric components are 
solved via linear algebra every time the model is fitted using a process called an inversion. This inversion always 
computes ``intensity`` values that give the best fit to the data (e.g. they maximize the likelihood) given the other 
parameter values of the light profile.

The ``intensity`` parameter of each light profile is therefore not a free parameter in the model-fit, reducing the
dimensionality of non-linear parameter space by the number of light profiles (in the example below by 3) and removing 
the degeneracies that occur between the ``intnensity`` and other light profile
parameters (e.g. ``effective_radius``, ``sersic_index``).

For complex models, linear light profiles are a powerful way to simplify the parameter space to ensure the best-fit
model is inferred.

.. code-block:: python

    sersic_linear = ag.lp_linear.Sersic()
    
    galaxy_model_linear = af.Model(
        ag.Galaxy,
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=ag.lp_linear.DevVaucouleurs,
        disk=ag.lp_linear.Sersic,
        bar=ag.lp_linear.Gaussian,
    )

Basis Functions
---------------

A natural extension of linear light profiles are basis functions, which group many linear light profiles together in
order to capture complex and irregular structures in a galaxy's emission.

Using a clever model parameterization a basis can be composed which corresponds to just N = 3-6 non-linar parameters,
making model-fitting efficient and robust.

Below, we compose a basis of 10 Gaussians which all share the same `centre` and `ell_comps`. Their `sigma`
values are set via the relation `y = a + (log10(i+1) + b)`, where `i` is the  Gaussian index and `a` and `b` are free
parameters.

Because `a` and `b` are free parameters (as opposed to `sigma` which can assume many values), we are able to
compose and fit `Basis` objects which can capture very complex light distributions with just N = 5-10 non-linear
parameters!

.. code-block:: python

    bulge_a = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=0.2)
    bulge_b = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=10.0)

    gaussians_bulge = af.Collection(af.Model(ag.lp_linear.Gaussian) for _ in range(10))

    for i, gaussian in enumerate(gaussians_bulge):

        gaussian.centre = gaussians_bulge[0].centre
        gaussian.ell_comps = gaussians_bulge[0].ell_comps
        gaussian.sigma = bulge_a + (bulge_b * np.log10(i+1))

    bulge = af.Model(
        ag.lp_basis.Basis, light_profile_list=gaussians_bulge,
    )

The bulge's ``info`` attribute describes the basis model composition:

.. code-block:: python

    print(bulge.info)

**PyAutoGalaxy** also supports Shapelet basis functions, which are appropriate for capturing exponential / disk-like
features in a galaxy.

This is illustrated in full on the ``autogalaxy_workspace`` in the example
script autogalaxy_workspace/scripts/imaging/modeling/advanced/shapelets.py .

**PyAutoGalaxy** can also apply Bayesian regularization to Basis functions, which smooths the linear light profiles
(e.g. the Gaussians) in order to prevent over-fitting noise.

.. code-block:: python

    bulge = af.Model(
        al.lp_basis.Basis, light_profile_list=gaussians_lens, regularization=al.reg.Constant
    )
