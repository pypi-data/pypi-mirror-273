"countme=N" does _not_ get added in subsequent\nrequests to the chosen mirror(s).\n\n### Privacy, randomization, and user counting\n\nDNF makes a serious effort to keep the `countme` data anonymous _and_ accurate\nby only sending `countme` with one _random_ request to each enabled repo _per\nweek_. So how does it decide when the week starts, and how does it choose\nwhich request?\n\nFirst, all clients use the same "week": Week 0 started at timestamp 345600\n(Mon 05 Jan 1970 00:00:00 - the first Monday of POSIX time), and weeks are\nexactly 604800 (7&times;24&times;60&times;60) seconds long.\n\nSecond, all clients have the same random chance - currently 1:4 - to send\n`countme` with any request in a given week. Once it\'s been sent, the client\nwon\'t send another `countme` for that repo for the rest of the week.\n\nThe default update interval for the `updates` repo is 6 hours, which means\nthat clients who use `dnf-makecache.service` will probably send `countme`\nsometime in the first 24 hours of a given week - and nothing for the rest of\nthe week.\n\nThis means that _daily_ totals of users are unreliably variable, since the\nstart of the week will have more `countme` requests than the end of the week.\nBut the weekly totals should be a consistent, representative sample of the\ntotal population.\n\nFor more details on how libdnf handles the randomization, see\n[libdnf/repo/Repo.cpp:addCountmeFlag()].\n\n### Data collected\n\nThe only data we look at is in the HTTP request itself. Our log lines are in\nthe standard Combined Log Format, like so[^IPvBeefy]:\n\n```\n240.159.140.173 - - [29/Mar/2020:16:04:28 +0000] "GET /metalink?repo=fedora-modular-32&arch=x86_64&countme=1 HTTP/2.0" 200 18336 "-" "libdnf (Fedora 32; workstation; Linux.x86_64)"\n```\n\n\nWe only look at log lines where the request is "GET", the query string includes\n"countme=N", the result is 200 or 302, and the User-Agent string matches the\nlibdnf User-Agent header.\n\nThe only data we use are the timestamp, the query parameters (`repo`, `arch`,\n`countme`), and the libdnf User-Agent data.\n\n#### libdnf User-Agent data\n\nAs in the log line above, the User-Agent header that libdnf sends looks like this:\n\n```\nUser-Agent: libdnf (Fedora 32; workstation; Linux.x86_64)\n```\n\nThis string is assembled in [libdnf/utils/os-release.cpp:getUserAgent()] and\nthe format is as follows:\n\n```\n{product} ({os_name} {os_version}; {os_variant}; {os_canon}.{os_arch})\n```\n\nwhere the values are:\n\n`product`\n:  "libdnf"\n\n`os_name`\n:  [/etc/os-release] `NAME`\n\n`os_version`\n:  [/etc/os-release] `VERSION_ID`\n\n`os_variant`\n:  [/etc/os-release] `VARIANT_ID`\n\n`os_canon`\n:  rpm `%_os` (via libdnf `getCanonOS()`)\n\n`os_arch`\n:  rpm `%_arch` (via libdnf `getBaseArch()`)\n\n(Older versions of libdnf sent `libdnf/{LIBDNF_VERSION}` for the `product`,\nbut the version string was dropped in libdnf 0.37.2 due to privacy concerns;\nsee [libdnf commit d8d0984].)\n\n#### `repo=`, `arch=`, `countme=`\n\nThe `repo=` and `arch=` values are exactly what\'s set in the URL in the `.repo`\nfile.\n\n`repo` is whatever string appears after `repo=` in the repo\'s `metalink` URL.\nThe values that are accepted for `repo` are determined by [mirrormanager];\nsee [mirrormanager2/lib/repomap.py] for some of the gnarly details there.\n\n`arch` is usually set as `arch=$basearch`, which means that `os_arch` and\n`repo_arch` are usually the same value. But it _is_ valid for a client to\nuse a repo with an `arch=` that\'s different from rpm\'s `%_arch` - for example,\nan i686 system could use an i386 repo - so `repo_arch` and `os_arch` _may_ be\ndifferent values.\n\n`countme`, as discussed in [dnf.conf(5)], is a value from 1 to 4 indicating\nthe "age" of the system, counted in _full_ weeks since the system was\nfirst installed. The values are:\n\n1. One week or less (0-1 weeks)\n2. Up to one month (2-4 weeks)\n3. Up to six months (5-24 weeks)\n4. More than six months (25+ weeks)\n\nThese are defined in [libdnf/repo/Repo.cpp:COUNTME\\_BUCKETS].\n\n\n## OK but how do we actually use it in Fedora?\n\nBecause the raw log data contains IP and timestamps that could be used to\ntrack or identify users, we run the parsing and counting inside private parts\nof the Fedora infrastructure and only publish the anonymous aggregate data.\n\nIn practice, this is a three-part process:\n\n1. Run `countme-update-rawdb.sh` daily to parse log data into `rawdb`\n  * `rawdb` is a SQLite database of structured data for each `countme` hit\n  * Kept private since it contains IP addresses and timestamps\n  * Typical log data: ~6GB/day\n  * Typical parsing time: ~5min (Intel Core i7-6770HQ, 2.60GHz)\n  * Typical rawdb size: ~8MB/day for F32; I\'d guess keeping 1 year of data for\n    3 concurrent releases would take about 10GB.\n  * Retaining historical data lets us quickly recalculate counts if we\n    discover significant errors due to misconfigured/malicious clients\n2. Run `countme-update-totals.sh` to read `rawdb` and update `totalsdb`\n  * Counts up hits for each week, grouped by:\n    * System info: `os_name`, `os_version`, `os_variant`, `os_arch`, `sys_age`\n    * Repo requested: `repo_tag`, `repo_arch`\n  * Only generates data for weeks where we have complete log data\n  * No timestamps or IP addresses\n  * Typical parsing time: small, <=~5s\n  * Typical totalsdb size: ~55KB/week (~700 rows/week) for F32\n  * After update, (re)generate `totals.csv`\n3. Publish updated `totals.db` and `totals.csv`\n  * See https://data-analysis.fedoraproject.org/csv-reports/countme/\n  * Might end up in different places/forms in the future\n  * Can also run countme-weekly-totals-ui.sh command to see text data easily.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou need to be legally allowed to submit any contribution to this project.\nWhat this means in detail is laid out at the [Developer Certificate of Origin]\nwebsite.
