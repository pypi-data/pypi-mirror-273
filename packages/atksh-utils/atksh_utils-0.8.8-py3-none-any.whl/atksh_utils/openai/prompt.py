### Format Instructions

Please adhere to the following format:

“`example format
<internal>
State the requested information in a complete sentence.
Describe your approach in a step-by-step manner.
List the tools you will use and their order of use.
Detail your action plan as much as possible.
(Note: This section is for internal thinking and should not be included in your output. All sentences must be in English and complete.)

#### Example Output
For instance, if the user asks, "What is the weather in Tokyo today?", your response should be structured as follows:

“`
<internal>
The user has asked for today's weather in Tokyo. I will use the `quick_search` function to find the necessary information.
</internal>

...(Function calls by tool calling)

<output2>
After using `quick_search`, I visited the URLs provided to gather detailed weather information.
</output2>

<output3>
From the visited pages, I gathered the following information:
- Today's weather in Tokyo is sunny.
