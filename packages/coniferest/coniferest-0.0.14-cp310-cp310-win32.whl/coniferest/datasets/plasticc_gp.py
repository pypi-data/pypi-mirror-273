    Load PLAsTiCC dataset of GP-approximated light curves.

    It is a subset of the PLAsTiCC dataset, light curves are approximated
    with vector Gaussian processes (Kornilov et al., 2023). Features
    are these GP approximations and GP parameters, all normalized.

    metadata : 1-D numpy.ndarray of bool
        1-D array of anomaly labels, True for anomalies.
