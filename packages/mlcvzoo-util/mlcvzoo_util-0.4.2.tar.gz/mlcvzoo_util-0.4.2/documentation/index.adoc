[NOTE]
.Before reading this documentation
====
This documentation _complements_ the arc42 documentation of MLCVZoo Base.
Therefore, sections that are already described in general in the arc42 documentation of MLCVZoo Base are not described here.
However, to conform to the general structure of MLCVZoo Base's arc42 documentation, the main sections are retained, even though there may not necessarily be corresponding content here for all of them.
This documentation therefore only contains content and descriptions for components that are specific to this project.
For detailed information on sections not described in this documentation and for general information about MLCVZoo Base, please refer to the link:https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/silicon-economy/base/ml-toolbox/mlcvzoo-base/-/tree/main/documentation/index.adoc[MLCVZoo Base's arc42 documentation].
