def get_relative_stage_pos(reference_image, current_image):
    """
    Compute the relative stage rotation and tilt angles of the current image with respect to the reference image.
    Note that the returned rotation and tilt angles are following the sample reference frame illustrated in Figure 2
    in the Tutorial paper using the right hand rule, such that rotation is around Z\ :sub:`s` axis and tilt is
    around Y\ :sub:`s` axis. For both FEI/Thermofisher and Zeiss microscope, stage rotates clockwisely when a
    positive stage rotation is applied, which is opposite to the convention currently used. Therefore, a negative
    sign should be added when the returned value is used for SEM stage control.

    positive stage rotation => ECP pattern rotates clockwise
    positive stage tilt => ECP pattern moves DOWN

    Supported vendors are:
    * FEI/Thermofisher
    * Zeiss

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        Path and file name.

    Returns
        relative stage tilt and rotation in degrees and relative stage x, y, z in meters
