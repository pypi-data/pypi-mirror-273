# motion2telegram

> Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more cameras and is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed. I.e., it can detect motion.

motion2telegram applies a pre-configured set of motion and systemd service configuration files and a script to send a message including a picture to a Telegram user/group when motion is detected.

The intent of motion2telegram is to enable me to quickly setup a Raspberry Pi with a webcam to notify me through Telegram when motion is detected.

## Stack

- Raspberry Pi 1 B+
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) (Port of Debian Bookworm)
- Python 3.11.2
- Motion 4.5.1
- Logitech C270 HD WEBCAM

## Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi setup with a working network configuration and connected to the internet
- [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_build.html) installed
- A [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account
- A Telegram [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token)
- A user on Raspberry Pi OS to run the motion service. motion2telegram installation and motion service configuration is done in the context of this user. The user MUST be a member of the groups _motion_ and _video_
- A Python virtual environment

## Install with pip

Login with the user created to run the motion service. Create a directory, e.g. motion2telegram, and cd into it. From here on, you'll work in this directory. Create and activate a Python virtual environment and then

```bash
(venv) $ pip install motion2telegram
...
# Verify by version
(venv) $ motion2telegram -V
x.y.z
(venv) $
```

## Configuration

Create a motion.env file and change it's access permissions. This file is used by the motion service to retrieve the Telegram bot token and the recipient's chat id.

```bash
(venv) $ motion2telegram --init
```
Specify your Telegram chat id and bot token in the file motion.env

```bash
# motion.env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=
```

Configure motion and install /etc/motion/motion.conf and /lib/systemd/system/motion.service.

```bash
(venv) $ motion2telegram --configure
```

motion is configured to write logs into log/motion.log and media files into media/ relative to the current directory.

The motion systemd service will reference the motion.env file in the current directory. The command will stop, configure and bring the motion service back up.
