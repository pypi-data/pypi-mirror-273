"""Hacks to deal with multiple grpc libraries.

This module conditionally imports the base exceptions from the `grpclib` and `grpcio`
libraries, assigning them a new name:

- [`GrpclibError`][] for [`grpclib.GRPCError`][]
- [`GrpcioError`][] for [`grpc.aio.AioRpcError`][]

If the libraries are not installed, the module defines dummy classes with the same names
to avoid import errors.

This way exceptions can be caught from both libraries independently of which one is
used. The unused library will just never raise any exceptions.
