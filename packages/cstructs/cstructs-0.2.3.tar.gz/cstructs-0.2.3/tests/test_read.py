def test_read_basic():
    """
    Test case for reading basic data from a stream.

    This test case defines a datastruct using the `datastruct` decorator and the `DataStruct` metaclass.
    It reads two unsigned 8 bit values from a byte stream and asserts that the values are correctly read and assigned to the data structure.

    The expected values are:
    - `a`: 1
    - `b`: 2

def test_read_complex():
    """
    Test case for reading complex data using a datastruct.

    This test case verifies that the datastruct can correctly read complex data from a stream.

    The Test class is defined using the `datastruct` decorator and the `DataStruct` metaclass.
    It has several fields of different types, including integers, bytes, and strings.

    The test case creates a `BytesIO` stream and writes a sequence of bytes representing the complex data.
    It then seeks back to the beginning of the stream and uses the `Test.read` method to read the data.

    Finally, the test case asserts that the read data matches the expected values.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the assertions fail.
