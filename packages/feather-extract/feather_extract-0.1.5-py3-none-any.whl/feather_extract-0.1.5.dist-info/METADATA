## Installation

To install `feather-extract`, run the following command:
`pip install feather-extract`

## Extracting Text from Documents

To extract text from a PDF document, use the `extract_text_from_document` function:

`from feather_extract import extract_text_from_document`

`extracted_text = extract_text_from_document('path/to/document.pdf')`

This function uses the Azure Form Recognizer service to extract text from the document. You'll need to provide your Azure Form Recognizer API key and endpoint when prompted.

## Formatting Extracted Text

The format_extracted_text function takes the extracted text and formats it into a list of rows, each containing an item, quantity, and bar designation:
`from feather_extract import format_extracted_text`

`formatted_data = format_extracted_text(extracted_text)`

The formatted_data variable will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row with the following format: [item, quantity, bar_designation].
Saving Data to Excel

To save the formatted data to an Excel workbook, use the save_to_excel function:

`from feather_extract import save_to_excel`

`save_to_excel(headers, formatted_data, 'output.xlsx')`

This function creates a new Excel workbook, writes the headers and formatted data rows to the active worksheet, and saves the workbook to the specified file name ('output.xlsx' in this example).

## Dependencies

`feather-extract` relies on the following dependencies:

`azure-ai-formrecognizer` - For extracting text from PDF documents using the Azure Form Recognizer service.

`openpyxl` - For creating and writing data to Excel workbooks.

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install feather-extract using pip.
