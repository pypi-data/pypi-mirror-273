                    This creates a QuickUMLS spaCy component which can be used in modular pipelines.
                    This module adds entity Spans to the document where the entity label is the UMLS CUI and the Span's "underscore" object is extended to contains "similarity" and "semtypes" for matched concepts.
                    Note that this implementation follows and enforces a known spacy convention that entity Spans cannot overlap on a single token.
