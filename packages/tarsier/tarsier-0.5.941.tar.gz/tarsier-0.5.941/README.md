# Tarsier

If you've tried using GPT-4(V) to automate web interactions, you've probably run into questions like:

- How do you map LLM responses back into web elements?
- How can you mark up a page for an LLM better understand its action space?
- How do you feed a "screenshot" to a text-only LLM?

At Reworkd, we found ourselves reusing the same utility libraries to solve these problems across multiple projects.
Because of this we're now open-sourcing this simple utility library for multimodal web agents... Tarsier!
The video below demonstrates Tarsier usage by feeding a page snapshot into a langchain agent and letting it take actions.

https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier/assets/50181239/af12beda-89b5-4add-b888-d780b353304b

## How does it work?

Tarsier works by visually "tagging" interactable elements on a page via brackets + an id such as `[1]`.
In doing this, we provide a mapping between elements and ids for GPT-4(V) to take actions upon.
We define interactable elements as buttons, links, or input fields that are visible on the page.

Can provide a textual representation of the page. This means that Tarsier enables deeper interaction for even non multi-modal LLMs.
This is important to note given performance issues with existing vision language models.
Tarsier also provides OCR utils to convert a page screenshot into a whitespace-structured string that an LLM without vision can understand.

## Installation

```shell
pip install tarsier
```

## Usage

Visit our [cookbook](https://github.com/reworkd/Tarsier/tree/main/cookbook) for agent examples using Tarsier:

- [An autonomous LangChain web agent](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier/blob/main/cookbook/langchain-web-agent.ipynb) ü¶ú‚õìÔ∏è
- [An autonomous LlamaIndex web agent](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier/blob/main/cookbook/llama-index-web-agent.ipynb) ü¶ô

Otherwise, basic Tarsier usage might look like the following:

```python
import asyncio

from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from tarsier import Tarsier, GoogleVisionOCRService
import json

def load_google_cloud_credentials(json_file_path):
    with open(json_file_path) as f:
        credentials = json.load(f)
    return credentials

async def main():
    # To create the service account key, follow the instructions on this SO answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/46290808/1780891
    google_cloud_credentials = load_google_cloud_credentials('./google_service_acc_key.json')

    ocr_service = GoogleVisionOCRService(google_cloud_credentials)
    tarsier = Tarsier(ocr_service)

    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com")

        page_text, tag_to_xpath = await tarsier.page_to_text(page)

        print(tag_to_xpath)  # Mapping of tags to x_paths
        print(page_text)  # My Text representation of the page


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Keep in mind that Tarsier tags different types of elements differently to help your LLM identify what actions are performable on each element. Specifically:
- `[#ID]`: text-insertable fields (e.g. `textarea`, `input` with textual type)
- `[@ID]`: hyperlinks (`<a>` tags)
- `[$ID]`: other interactable elements (e.g. `button`, `select`)
- `[ID]`: plain text (if you pass `tag_text_elements=True`)

## Local Development

### Setup

We have provided a handy setup script to get you up and running with Tarsier development.

```shell
./script/setup.sh
```

If you modify any TypeScript files used by Tarsier, you'll need to execute the following command.
This compiles the TypeScript into JavaScript, which can then be utilized in the Python package.

```shell
npm run build
```

### Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing. To run the tests, simply run:

```shell
poetry run pytest .
```

### Linting

Prior to submitting a potential PR, please run the following to format your code:

```shell
./script/format.sh
```
