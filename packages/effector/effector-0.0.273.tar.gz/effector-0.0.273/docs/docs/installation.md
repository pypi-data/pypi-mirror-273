# Installation

`Effector` is compatible with `Python 3.7+`. We recommend to first create a virtual environment with `conda`:

```bash
conda create -n effector python=3.11 # any python 3.7+ will work
conda activate effector
```

and then install `Effector` via `pip`:

```bash
pip install effector
```

If you want to also run the Tutorial notebooks, add some more dependencies to the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
