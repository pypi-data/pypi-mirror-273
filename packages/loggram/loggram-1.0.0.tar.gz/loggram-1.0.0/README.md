## ⚠️ Security Notice

**Important:** Ensure the secure handling of your API keys and secrets. Do not hard code sensitive information directly in your source code. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store and retrieve confidential data.

For example, you can use the `python-decouple` library along with a `.env` file to manage your project's configuration:

1. Install `python-decouple`:

    ```bash
    pip install python-decouple
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and add your secret information:

    ```ini
    SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key
    ```

3. In your code, use `python-decouple` to access your configuration variables:

    ```python
    from decouple import config

    secret_key = config('SECRET_KEY')
    ```

By following secure practices, you help protect your application and sensitive data.
