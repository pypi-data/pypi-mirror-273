    "\n",
    "It it necessary to emphasize that, the computational nodes and monitor nodes are seperated. With `dflow`, you can deploy `dflow` and `rid` on your PC and achieve expensive computation on other resources (like `Slurm` and Cloud Platform) without any further effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions of `dflow` installation are peovided in detail on its [Github page](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow#Installdflow). Prerequisites of `dflow` usage are `Docker` and `Kubenete`, where their main pages ([Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Kubenete](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)) include how you can install them. Besides, `dflow` repo also provides with easy-install shell scripts on [dflow/scripts](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/scripts) to install `Docker` & `Kubenete` & `dflow` and make port-forwarding."
