MediBot_Charges.py

This module provides a helper function for MediBot.py, specifically designed to handle the charge entry process in Medisoft for patients undergoing cataract surgeries. Each patient typically undergoes procedures on both eyes, treated as separate procedures but often requiring price bundling to address patient preferences for consistent billing across both eyes.

Key Features:
- Handles up to 200 patients in a single batch, with typical usage around 20 patients.
- Implements price bundling logic to ensure that if a patient has multiple procedures (one for each eye), the charges are balanced such that the total cost is evenly spread across both procedures. This approach aligns with patient expectations of receiving consistent charges for each eye.
- Integrates pricing schedules from a configuration file for private insurance, which vary based on the duration of the procedure:
    - $450 for 1-15 minutes
    - $480 for 16-22 minutes
    - $510 for 23-27 minutes
    - $540 for 28-37 minutes
    - $580 for 37-59 minutes (59 minutes being the maximum allowed duration)
- Special handling for Medicare patients, details of which are pending clarification.

Limitations:
- The bundling logic for commercial insurance billing is subject to the fulfillment of deductibles and other conditions, which do not necessarily synchronize with the timing of procedures for both eyes. The exact mechanics of this bundling under various conditions remain partially unspecified.

Usage:
- This module is intended to be used as part of the MediBot system, interfaced through MediBot.py, to automate the data entry and billing process in Medisoft for ophthalmology clinics, specifically those performing cataract surgeries.

Note:
- The exact implementation details for Medicare patients and the full logic for price bundling under all insurance conditions are yet to be finalized and documented.
