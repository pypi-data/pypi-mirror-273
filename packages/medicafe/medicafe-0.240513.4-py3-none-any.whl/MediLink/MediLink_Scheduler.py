"""
MediLink Scheduler: A medical claim scheduling and management system that integrates functionalities from MediScheduler and MediLink to optimize medical claim submissions based on patient deductible status, insurance provider deadlines, and a 90-day submission window. It leverages real-time data from insurance APIs for dynamic scheduling to maximize insurance payments by aligning claim submission with deductible fulfillment.

Features:
- Deductible Optimization: Determines optimal submission times based on deductible fulfillment to maximize reimbursements.
- Dynamic Scheduling: Updates claim submission timelines in response to changes in deductible status and insurance coverage data.
- Secure Data Handling: Ensures the security of sensitive patient data through encryption and HIPAA-compliant practices.
- Integration with MediLink Systems: Seamlessly formats, submits, and tracks claims across MediLink and associated systems.
- Robust Error Handling and Notifications: Implements mechanisms for error detection and user alerts regarding scheduling and submission errors.

Main Functionalities:
1. Configuration and System Initialization:
   - Configures and establishes secure connections to insurance APIs.
   - Loads encrypted system settings and initializes subsystems for logging, data encryption, and notifications.

2. Scheduler Integration:
   - Enhances MediLink's main menu to include an option for "Optimize and Schedule Submissions".
   - This option is visible only when there are new or imminent claims, activating the scheduling function for these claims.

3. Scheduling Process:
   - Identifies new or urgent claims.
   - Fetches real-time deductible information from insurance APIs.
   - Computes remaining deductible and determines suitable submission dates.
   - Schedules claims with consideration for deductible status and the 90-day deadline, updating a scheduling log with details.

4. User Dashboard Update:
   - Displays scheduled submissions, including deductible statuses and scheduled dates.
   - Allows users to manually adjust or override automated scheduling decisions.

5. Pre-Submission Checks:
   - Daily verification of claims ready for submission.
   - Prepares 837P claim files and finalizes submission details with user confirmation.
   - Securely transmits data to insurance providers and logs all submission activities.

6. Direct Submission Handling:
   - Uses MediLink_Up.submit_claims to manage final claim submissions.
   - Ensures that all scheduled claims are submitted with requisite details.

7. Data Security:
   - Applies encryption to any new data storage or sensitive data involved in the scheduling process.
   - Maintains compliance with HIPAA and relevant security standards.

8. Error Management and Alerts:
   - Extends error handling capabilities to include specific scheduling and submission issues.
   - Enhances notifications for reminders and updates on deductible status.

9. Integration with MediLink Logging and Error Handling:
   - Integrates scheduler operations into MediLinkâ€™s existing logging and error management frameworks.

10. Maintenance and Data Cleanup:
    - Regularly refreshes insurance data mappings and updates deductible information.
    - Manages cleanup of processed claims to maintain database integrity and performance.

11. User Interface Improvements:
    - Updates UI to ensure user-friendliness and provides clear operational feedback.
    - Revises help documentation to reflect new functionalities and guides for scheduling tasks.

Database Management:
- Maintains a JSON-based database for patient billing data, labeled as patient_billing_db, storing information from various sources (Z.dat file, APIs, SFTP).
- Database content includes claim statuses, deductible details, error logs, and identifiers for billing readiness.
- Facilitates efficient tracking and processing of claims, with considerations for integrating individual patient data in batched submissions.
- Stays on the local machine in a defined secure location per config, ensuring HIPAA compliance without the need for data encryption at rest.

Note: Potential for data corruption or synchronization issues due to system limitations; backup and manual verification measures are advised.
