"""
Development Tasks for Backend Enhancement in MediSoft Claims Submittal (MediLink) Script:

Implement dynamic configurations for multiple endpoints (Availity, Optum, PNT Data) with environmental settings support.
Enhance file detection with detailed logging and introduce integrity checks for pre-processing validation.
Verify file transmissions via WinSCP log analysis for successful endpoint acknowledgments and secure data transfer.
Automate response file handling from endpoints and integrate feedback into MediSoft with exception alerts.
De-persisting Intermediate Files.
When transmissions fail, there is some retaining of patient data in memory or something that seems to default
any new endpoint changes to Optum. May need to "de-confirm" patients, but leave the suggested endpoints as the previously
confirmed endpoints. This should be similar logic to if the user made a mistake and wants to go back and fix it.
These tasks involve backend enhancements such as dynamic configurations, file detection improvements, file transmission verification, automation of response file handling, and management of intermediate files and transmission failures.

TODO (Low) Availity has a response file that says "File was received at TIME. File was sent for processing." as a confirmation 
that sits in the SendFiles folder after a submittal. 

TODO (Crosswalk) When an endpoint is updated in the UI, the crosswalk should also be updated and saved for that payer ID because that payer ID
would basically forever need to be going to that endpoint for any patient. the suggested_endpoint should eventually be always correct.

BUG Suggested Endpoint when you say 'n' to proceed with transmission is not getting updated with the endpoint 
that was selected previously by the user. However, when we go back to the confirmation list, we do have a persist of the assignment.
This can be confusing for the user.
