"""
Draft Docstring to move over from Preprocessor.

Data Integrity and Validation
 Implement a mechanism to confirm the accuracy of entered data, potentially through a verification step or summary report.
 Enhance CSV integrity checks to identify and report potential issues with data format, especially concerning insurance policy numbers and special character handling.

Development Roadmap for crosswalk_update()
 Automation required for updating the crosswalk.json when new Medisoft insurance is discovered.
For open_csv_for_editing

Known Issues and Bugs
 Address the handling of '.' and other special characters that may disrupt parsing, especially under Windows XP.

For load_csv_data

Preprocessing Enhancements
 Optimize script startup and CSV loading to reduce initial latency.

Data Integrity and Validation
 Conduct a thorough CSV integrity check before processing to flag potential issues upfront.

Future Work
 Consolidate data from multiple sources (Provider_Notes.csv, Surgery_Schedule.csv, and Carols_CSV.csv) into a single table with Patient ID as the key, ensuring all data elements are aligned and duplicate entries are minimized.
 Implement logic to verify and match Patient IDs across different files to ensure data integrity before consolidation. (Catching errors between source data)
 Optimize the preprocessing of surgery dates and diagnosis codes for use in patient billing and scheduling systems.
