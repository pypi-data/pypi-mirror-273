    """
    Calculates the Awesome Oscillator from the given high and low price data.

    The Awesome Oscillator is a technical analysis indicator that measures market momentum.

    Parameters:
    high (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the high price data.
    low (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the low price data.
    slow_period (int): The number of periods for calculating the slow moving average.
    fast_period (int): The number of periods for calculating the fast moving average.

    Returns:
    pd.Series: A Series containing the Awesome Oscillator values.

    Example:
    # Assuming 'high' and 'low' are DataFrames with the high and low price data
    awesome_oscillator = Awesome_Oscillator(high, low, slow_period=34, fast_period=5)
    """

    # Calculate Midpoint Price
    midpoint_price = (high + low) / 2

    # Calculate Fast Moving Average (5-period)
    fast_ma = midpoint_price.rolling(window=fast_period).mean()

    # Calculate Slow Moving Average (34-period)
    slow_ma = midpoint_price.rolling(window=slow_period).mean()

    # Calculate Awesome Oscillator
    awesome_oscillator = fast_ma - slow_ma

    return awesome_oscillator
