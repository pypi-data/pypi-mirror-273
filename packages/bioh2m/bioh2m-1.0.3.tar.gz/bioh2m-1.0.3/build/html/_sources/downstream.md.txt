# COMING SOON - H2M Database Online Portal

We pre-computed 

1. Murine equivalents of over 3,000,000 human variants derived from **ClinVar**, **COSMIC**, and **AACR-GENIE**;

2. Base editing guide RNAs for over 3,000,000 human-mouse variant pairs;

3. Prime eiditing guide RNAs for a 5,000 subset of hotspot human mutations and their murine equivalents.

We are going to make it available as an online resource.  

## PEGG: Prime Editing Guide Generator  
[PEGG](https://pegg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a python package that designs prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) and base editing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for use in precision genome editing.  

## PATTERN
[Pattern](https://pattern.broadinstitute.org/#/) is a recharge center that provides support to the greater Broad community. We specialize in design and development projects that create greater scientific understanding and impact.
