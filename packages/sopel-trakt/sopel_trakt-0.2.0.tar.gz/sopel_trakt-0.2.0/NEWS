### 0.2.0

Revived by new maintainer ([dgw](https://github.com/dgw)) under a new package
name (`sopel-modules.trakt` â†’ `sopel-trakt`). Major changes include:

* Config setting `api` renamed to `client_id`
* Updated coding standards for Sopel 7.1+ and Python 3.8+
* Dropped [`sopel_modules` namespace][namespace-plugin] in favor of a
  [`setuptools` entry point][entry-point-plugin]

Much of the work in this release was spent on housekeeping; user-facing
functionality is essentially unchanged from the last release published on PyPI
by [sharktamer](https://pypi.org/user/sharktamer/).
