# sopel-trakt

A Sopel plugin to fetch users' recent Trakt plays

## Installation

Can be installed from PyPI using:

    pip install sopel-trakt

## Configuration

`sopel-trakt` has one required configuration value: your API app's client ID.
You can run `sopel-plugins configure trakt` to set it interactively, or add a
section for this plugin to your bot's `.cfg` file directly:

```ini
[trakt]
client_id = LongRandomStringProvidedByTrakt
```

Create or retrieve your Trakt API app's client ID at https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications

## Testing

If you would like to make a contribution, be sure to run the included tests. Test requirements can be installed using:

    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

run tests using:

    make test

## Credits

Adopted from a Sopel 6 plugin, `sopel_modules.trakt`: https://github.com/surskitt/sopel-trakt

### 0.2.0

Revived by new maintainer ([dgw](https://github.com/dgw)) under a new package
name (`sopel-modules.trakt` â†’ `sopel-trakt`). Major changes include:

* Config setting `api` renamed to `client_id`
* Updated coding standards for Sopel 7.1+ and Python 3.8+
* Dropped [`sopel_modules` namespace][namespace-plugin] in favor of a
  [`setuptools` entry point][entry-point-plugin]

Much of the work in this release was spent on housekeeping; user-facing
functionality is essentially unchanged from the last release published on PyPI
by [sharktamer](https://pypi.org/user/sharktamer/).
