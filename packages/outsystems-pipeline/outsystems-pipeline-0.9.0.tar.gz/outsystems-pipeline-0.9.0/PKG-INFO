What's new
==========

**Download Application Source Code**

 A new script was added to download platform-generated source code:

 * `fetch_apps_source_code.py`

 Use the following parameters to generate more human-readable outputs and facilitate the compilation of the source code:

 * --friendly_package_names: source code packages with user-friendly names.
 * --include_all_refs: adds to .csproj file all assemblies in the bin folder as references.
 * --remove_resources_files: removes references to embedded resources files from the.csproj file.

**Solution Download and Deploy**

 Added new functions to leverage the recently released/improved APIs to download and deploy outsystems packages:

 * `fetch_lifetime_solution_from_manifest.py` - downloads a solution file based on manifest data.
 * `deploy_package_to_target_env.py` - deploys an outsystems package (solution or application) to a target environment.
 * `deploy_package_to_target_env_with_osptool.py` - deploys an outsystems package (solution or application) using OSP Tool.

**Improved OSPTool Operations**

 OSPTool command line calls now have live output callback and catalog mapping support.

**Updated Package Dependencies**

 * Updated python-dateutil dependency to version 2.9.0.post0
 * Updated python-dotenv dependency to version 1.0.1
