== Introduction

=== Silicon Economy

****
In a Silicon Economy, services are executed and used via platforms.
A Silicon Economy Platform consists of five different kinds of major components, namely one or more SE Services, one or more IDS connectors, a Logistics Broker, an optional IoT Broker and an optional Blockchain Full-Node.
This platform is the environment of SE Services, its location does not matter (e.g., IT environment of a company, a cloud environment, etc.).

SE Services are professional (logistics) services, consisting of IT and/or physical services.
They are part of a functional (logistics) process and can be linked and subsequently orchestrated in the sense of that process.

Furthermore, SE Services can be integrated into existing structures, and must be able to be executed and monitored.
SE Services are documented.
SE Services must be able to be booked and accounted for and have a (technical) description that includes all information about the function of the service and the conditions of use.
Finally, SE Services must be able to be supplied with data and must be able to be called via the IDS.

=== Machine Learning Toolbox as a Silicon Economy Platform Component
Artificial Intelligence and especially Machine Learning (ML) are important technologies for SE Services. They allow to map more complex interrelationships than traditional methods and make use of patterns in data. The ML Toolbox supports the development of ML software by providing tools for frequently occurring tasks in the development process of every ML application. It is structured by process steps of the project (data generation, preprocessing, modeling, postprocessing) as well as the area of ML (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, time series prediction) the tool supports.

The following diagram shows the structure and components of the ML Toolbox:

The MLCVZoo (Machine Learning Computer Vision Zoo) is one of the first components to be added to the ML Toolbox. It supports the development of computer vision applications by integrating models from various frameworks via a unifying API. By doing so, it eliminates the effort of integrating frameworks individually with every new computer vision project, and allows to compare and evaluate different models for a computer vision task.
In the diagram below, the components and internal structure of the MLCVZoo can be seen. It is inspired by the well-known https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/CRISP-DM-1.0%3A-Step-by-step-data-mining-guide-Chapman-Clinton/54bad20bbc7938991bf34f86dde0babfbd2d5a72[_CRISP-DM - **CR**oss **I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining_]. Figure <<mlcvzoo-big-picture-05, 1>> states the main phases of the process and where they align with the MLCVZoo. More details about the structure are given in chapter <<Building Block View, 5>>.
