# AntPack

AntPack is a toolkit for antibody numbering, data processing, statistical inference and
machine learning for antibody sequences. It is currently in
active development -- more updates soon! For installation and how to
use, see [the docs](https://antpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## What's new in version 0.2.0

Starting in version 0.2.0, there are only two dependencies, numpy and pybind. We've
also simplified the SingleChainAnnotator API slightly (this does cause a possible
breaking change). We've also introduced a tool for extracting the variable heavy
and light regions from a sequence that may contain both, a tool for detecting
common liabilities in antibody variable region sequences (N-glycosylation motifs,
deamidation motifs, etc.), and a tool for identifying the human V or J gene *most*
similar to an input sequence.


### Antibody numbering

Numbering antibody sequences is an important precursor for many statistical inference /
machine learning applications. AntPack is orders of magnitude faster for numbering
antibody sequences than existing tools in the literature (e.g. ANARCI, AbRSA),
while providing >= reliability.


### V / J genes

Identifying the most similar human V / J gene sequences is useful for a variety of
purposes. AntPack provides tools for determining which human V and J gene sequences
are most similar to the variable region chain provided as input.


### Humanness and developability

Minimizing the risk of immunogenicity is important for selecting clinical
candidates. In AntPack v0.1.0, we introduce a simple, fully interpretable
generative model for human heavy and light chains that outperforms all
comparators in the literature on a large held-out test set for distinguishing
human sequences from those of other species. This scoring tool can be used
to score sequences for humanness, suggest modifications to make them more
human, identify liabilities, and generate highly human sequences that contain
selected motifs.


### Finding developability liabilities

Some sequence motifs are known to be associated with developability issues -- certain
motifs are known, for example, to be prone to N-glycosylation or deamidation. AntPack
provides a tool for finding these "liability" motifs in an input sequence. Note that
that identifying liabilities through finding motifs in this way is known to be prone
to false positives (an N-glycosylation motif, for example, will not always be glycosylated).
Still, these kinds of alerts can be useful for making yourself aware of potential
developability issues.
