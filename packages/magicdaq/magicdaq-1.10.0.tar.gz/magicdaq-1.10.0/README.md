### Measurement & Automation Board Overview

An extensive set of hardware testing capabilities can be accessed by connecting the MagicDAQ to the [M&A Board](https://www.magicdaq.com/product/ma-board-full-kit/). The M&A Board can be used in conjunction with the MagicDAQ, an alternative USB DAQ, or can be used stand alone.

M&A Board Key Features:

* 3 Current measurement circuits, 5A maximum
* 1 Low current measurement circuit, measures uAs
* 4 Temperature measurement probes, -55C to 125C range
* 4 Switching relays, 10A maximum switching capacity
* 1 Variable voltage power output, 1V to 10V range, 2A maximum current output
* 2 Fixed voltage power outputs: 3.3V and 12V
