geckordp
=

This is a client implementation of Firefox DevTools over remote debug protocol in python.

It essentially exposes the raw api to interact with the debug server and has some similarities with a common webdriver. See also [Documentation](https://jpramosi.github.io/geckordp).

***What's possible with geckordp?***

Geckordp is meant to be used as a low level library to build tools on top.
With a few helpers like the WebExtension-API and a proxy server, it can be feature rich enough for:

+ web ui-testing
+ extension testing
+ browser test tools
+ webdriver
+ data scraping
+ https recording
+ network traffic analysis
+ remote controller for browser
+ ...and possibly more


## Getting Started
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

To use Geckordp, install it with:

```bash
pip install geckordp
# python -m pip install geckordp
# python -m pip install geckordp[develop]
```
Documentation can be generated with:
```bash
sphinx-build -a -c docs/src -b html docs/build docs
```
Package signature can be checked with:
```bash
pip download --no-deps geckordp
wget https://github.com/jpramosi.gpg -O pub.gpg
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpramosi/geckordp/master/signatures/geckordp-latest.zip.asc -O latest.asc
gpg --no-default-keyring --output pub.sig --dearmor pub.gpg
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./pub.sig --verify latest.asc geckordp-*.zip
```
```bash
# exemplary output:
gpg: Signature made So 23 Okt 2022 14:08:20 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 21F942661941E642894267539B8551A5AEA1227A

```

## Usage
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

```python
import json

from geckordp.actors.root import RootActor
from geckordp.firefox import Firefox
from geckordp.profile import ProfileManager
from geckordp.rdp_client import RDPClient

""" Uncomment to enable debug output
"""
# from geckordp.settings import GECKORDP
# GECKORDP.DEBUG = 1
# GECKORDP.DEBUG_REQUEST = 1
# GECKORDP.DEBUG_RESPONSE = 1


def main():
    # clone default profile to 'geckordp'
    pm = ProfileManager()
    profile_name = "geckordp"
    port = 6000
    pm.clone("default-release", profile_name)
    profile = pm.get_profile_by_name(profile_name)
    profile.set_required_configs()

    # start firefox with specified profile
    Firefox.start("https://example.com/", port, profile_name, ["-headless"])

    # create client and connect to firefox
    client = RDPClient()
    client.connect("localhost", port)

    # initialize root
    root = RootActor(client)

    # get a list of tabs
    tabs = root.list_tabs()
    print(json.dumps(tabs, indent=2))

    input()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Geckordp requires minimum Python 3.10 and the latest Firefox build. Older versions of Firefox may also work as long the API changes are not too drastically. In case of doubt, clone and run tests with:
```bash
cd <your-repositories-path>
git clone https://github.com/jpramosi/geckordp
cd geckordp
python -m pip uninstall geckordp
python -m pip install -e $PWD
pytest tests/ &> test.log
```


## Archived Versions
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

Older versions of Geckordp with its corresponding Firefox version can be found [here](https://github.com/jpramosi/geckordp/blob/master/VERSIONS.md). But keep in mind it may have missing actors or bug-fixes.


## Contribute
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

Every help in form of issues, questions or pull requests are very appreciated. If you would like to improve the project there are a few things to keep in mind:

For submitted code:
* formatting
* tests required (if new)
* should basically reflect the geckodriver api (if possible)

For issues or improvements see [here](https://github.com/jpramosi/geckordp/issues/new).

Eventually you can also contribute to the project just by asking what do you need (examples, a specific task, features or whether something is feasible) on the issue tracker. Often it will also help other users too.


## Develop
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

To get an idea what's missing, here is a rough list of some notable objectives:

* add remaining actors from geckodriver
* add documentation for *all* actors its functions (even official repository got none)

If you are willing to get your hands dirty, please follow me [here](https://github.com/jpramosi/geckordp/blob/master/dev/README.md).


## Technical Details
<!-- SEPARATOR -->

To be able to communicate with the server, a pre-configured profile is required.

Geckordp offers additional helper functions to resolve this problem with the [ProfileManager](https://jpramosi.github.io/geckordp/geckordp.profile.html#geckordp.profile.ProfileManager).

The following flags are changed on profile configuration:

    ### disable crash-recover after 'ungraceful' process termination
    ("browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash", False)

    ### disable safe-mode after 'ungraceful' process termination
    ("browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes", 0)
    ("toolkit.startup.max_resumed_crashes", -1)
    ("browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand", False)
    ("browser.sessionstore.restore_tabs_lazily", False)

    ### set download folder (not set by firefox)
    ("browser.download.dir", str(Path.home()))

    ### enable compatibility
    ("devtools.chrome.enabled", True)

    ### don't open dialog to accept connections from client
    ("devtools.debugger.prompt-connection", False)

    ### enable remote debugging
    ("devtools.debugger.remote-enabled", True)

    ### allow tab isolation (for e.g. separate cookie-jar)
    ("privacy.userContext.enabled", True)

    ### misc
    ("devtools.cache.disabled", True)
    ("browser.aboutConfig.showWarning", False)
    ("browser.tabs.warnOnClose", False)
    ("browser.tabs.warnOnCloseOtherTabs", False)
    ("browser.shell.skipDefaultBrowserCheckOnFirstRun", True)
    ("pdfjs.firstRun", True)
    ("doh-rollout.doneFirstRun", True)
    ("browser.startup.firstrunSkipsHomepage", True)
    ("browser.tabs.warnOnOpen", False)
    ("browser.warnOnQuit", False)
    ("toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun", False)
    ("trailhead.firstrun.didSeeAboutWelcome", True)

<!-- SEPARATOR -->
Once the new profile was created, Firefox can be started with it.
However, actors need to be initialized at first.

Some actors need to call additional functions to get initialized on server-side.
But this is not always necessary and depends on what is actually needed.
These required functions and its actors are initialized respectively used in this order according to the [pcap-dumps](https://github.com/jpramosi/geckordp/blob/master/dev).


| Browser initialization:

    RDPClient()                 -> .connect()
        v
    RootActor()                 -> .get_root()
        v
    DeviceActor()               -> .get_description()
        v
    ProcessActor()              -> .get_target()
        v
    WebConsoleActor()           -> .start_listeners([])
        v
    ContentProcessActor()       -> .list_workers()

| Tab initialization:

    TabActor()                  -> .get_target()*
        v
    WebConsoleActor()           -> .start_listeners([])*
        v
    ThreadActor()               -> .attach()*
        v
    WatcherActor()              -> .watch_resources(...)*
        v
    TargetConfigurationActor()


\**required if this actor will be used or events are wanted*

The following hierarchy [diagram](https://jpramosi.github.io/geckordp/actors/modules.html) shows dependencies between the actors and how to initialize individual actors: [](#diagram)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpramosi/geckordp/master/actor-hierarchy.png)

For debugging purposes, Geckordp can be configured to print out requests and responses to better understand the structure of the json packets.
To enable it use:

```python
from geckordp.settings import GECKORDP
GECKORDP.DEBUG = 1
GECKORDP.DEBUG_REQUEST = 1
GECKORDP.DEBUG_RESPONSE = 1
# environment variables can also be used for e.g.
# GECKORDP_DEBUG_RESPONSE=1
```

<!-- SEPARATOR -->

Other noteworthy general hints, issues or experiences:

* actor initialization (plus the related functions like attach, watch or listening) on blank new tabs may get detached after visiting a new url and must be reinitiated (can be avoided if the page got a html header & body)
* received messages are just plain python dictionaries and most of the time it has consistent fields which can be directly accessed
* failed requests will return 'None'
* actors can have multiple contexts, that means different actor IDs can have the same actor model (for e.g. WebConsoleActor for process or tab)
* called functions within manually registered **async** handlers on RDPClient can not call functions which emitting 'RDPClient.send_receive()' later in its execution path (instead use non-async handlers in this case)
* on a new Firefox update it can happen that a few events doesn't get caught by the RDPClient handler or requests getting a wrong response, unfortunately a few event/response packets doesn't follow the same pattern and events must be manually specified in Geckordp which can have the implied side effects
