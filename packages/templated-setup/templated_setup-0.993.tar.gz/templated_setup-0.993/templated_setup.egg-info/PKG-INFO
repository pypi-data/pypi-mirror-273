# Standardized `setup.py`

## Overview

This project contains a Python-based setup automation tool designed to help streamline the process of preparing and managing project setups. It includes utilities for handling versioning, dates, notes, and README files, leveraging a dynamic caching system to maintain state across sessions.

## Word of Caution

:warning: **This project is still in development and should be used with caution.** :warning:

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Date Management:** Automatically manages the date of the last modification using a custom class.
- [ ] **Version Control:** Validates and stores version numbers with a strict format.
- [ ] **Notes Management:** Supports capturing and formatting release notes for easy inclusion in project documentation.
- [ ] **Automated Setup:** Integrates with `setuptools` for seamless package distribution preparation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `setuptools` module

## Usage

1. **Initialization:** Start by configuring the basic project parameters like name, version, and description.
2. **Parameter Management:** Through interactive prompts, manage various parameters including version number,
                               modification dates, and release notes.
3. **Setup Execution:** Execute the setup to generate distribution packages and, optionally, publish them to PyPi.
