- Lucy organizes your competitive programming workspace with a clear directory structure. Besides folders for specific contests and their solutions with `tests`, a key element is the `common` directory. This folder stores reusable code snippets `(*.cpp)`. These snippets can be easily inserted into your solution files using filename prefixes thanks to the `cp.code-snippets` file in the `.vscode` folder. This file, automatically generated with `lucy update-snippets`,  facilitates code completion within Visual Studio Code.
