# PingDing

## Description
Network tool, which continuously pings and displays various nodes on a network

## Lore of the name
When I saw a collegue working a system (with many network nodes), when there was trouble he kept resorting to typing ping to various boards. I realised we needed a thing (ding in dutch) that pings all relevant nodes and displays it in a simple overview. This way, as long as everything is green, you dont have to ping anything because you know its up. Also if something turns red, you are not wasting your time on wierd behavior of the system, but instantly know a connection broke.

So the name was trivial (in dutch :P), a thing that pings: PingDing!
