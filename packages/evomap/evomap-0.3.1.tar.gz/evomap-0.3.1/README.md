# evomap - A Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python

`evomap` offers a comprehensive toolbox to create, explore and analyze spatial representations ('maps') from relationship data. Common applications include Marketing (market structure analysis), Network Analysis (e.g., social, economic, or biological networks), Political Science, or High-Dimensional Data Analysis in general. 

Often, relationship data is retrievable over time, as markets and networks tend to evolve. `evomap` provides all necessary tools to analyze such data in maps either in static snapshots at a single point in time, or in evolving maps across multiple periods. `evomap` provides an all-in-one solution and integrates many steps of the analysis into an easy-to-use API. Specifically, `evomap` includes modules for 

- preprocessing
- mapping (static/dynamic)
- evaluation
- plotting

Note: As of now, `evomap` is available as a ***pre-release version*** and parts of `evomap` are still under active development. For any bug reports or feature requests, <a href = 'mailto:mpmatthe@iu.edu'>please get in touch</a>.

## Installation

This pre-release is available via PyPi. 

To install `evomap` run
```bash
pip install evomap
```

`evomap` works best with Python version 3.9. We recommend using Python within a virtual environment, for instance via conda:
```bash
conda create -n evomap python=3.9
conda activate evomap
pip install evomap
```

**Note:** Currently, `evomap` builds its C extensions upon installation on the system. Thus, it requires a C compiler to be present. The right C compiler depends upon your system, e.g. GCC on Linux or MSVC on Windows. For details, see <a href = 'https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html'>the Cython documentation</a>. In future versions, extensions will be pre-compiled.

## Usage

The following tutorials provide a good starting point for using `evomap`. 

For a simple introduction to a typical market structure application, see <a href = 'https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/car%20application.html'>this example</a>.

If you want to dive deaper into what `evomap` has to offer, check out the following examples on

1. <a href = 'https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/static%20mapping.html'>Static Mapping</a>
2. <a href = 'https://evomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dynamic%20mapping.html'>Dynamic Mapping</a>

Updated versions of these examples will be available as new features are released. 

## Mapping Methods

As of now, `evomap` provides implementations of the following mapping methods:
- MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)
- Sammon Mapping (non-linear MDS)
- t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

You can apply all methods statically and dynamically. Moreover, `evomap` follows the syntax conventions of `scikit-learn`, such that other 
machine-learning techniques (such as LLE, Isomap, ... ) can easily be integrated. For more background, see <a href = 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html'> here</a>.
