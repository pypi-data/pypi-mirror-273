#   The packages.find specification above, for whatever reason, ignores all
#   top-level modules (i.e., `*.py` files that can be imported). We work
#   around this by explicitly adding our top-level module to py-modules.
#   (Note that this must be a Python module name, not a filename.) This
#   configuration directive is mentioned but not documented, but it seems
#   to add additional modules to the list that `packages.find` comes up with.
