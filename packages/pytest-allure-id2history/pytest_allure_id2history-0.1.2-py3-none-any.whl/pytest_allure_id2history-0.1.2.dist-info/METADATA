Overwrite allure history id with testcase full name and testcase id if testcase has id, exclude parameters.

----

When the library is not installed,the ``historyId`` of the test cases generated by ``Allure`` is based on dynamic parameters within the test case, and each execution is not considered the same test case. After installing the library, when a test case id is configured, even with dynamic parameters, it will be recognized as the same test case.


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-allure-id2history" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-allure-id2history


Usage
-----

::

    import random
    import pytest


    @pytest.mark.parametrize('arg', [
        random.randint(0, 9999)
    ], ids=['some-id'])
    def test_foo(arg):
        print(f'Testing foo with {arg}')
