## Setting up developer environment

This project uses the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager.
Please follow the [official](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) documentation for installation details

In addition to Poetry, this project also uses the package [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet)
for running simple tasks with poetry.

With Poetry installed, you set up the virtual environment and install the dependencies with a single command:

```shell
poetry install
```

Configure the pre-commit hooks

```shell
pre-commit install
```
